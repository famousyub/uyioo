","A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human.

His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship.

","I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are.

25 November 2014,zardoz-13,10," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

1 November 2014,tardieu-felix,10," Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey
","The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2014,tavm,9," Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative
","Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2015,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,9," Leaves you wondering
","A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular).

","8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating ""long-distance"" relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet.

The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius.

7 November 2014,shawneofthedead,7," A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.
","Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities. In fact, this is the most emotion driven movie I've seen from Nolan, something that he isn't ultimately known for. Nolan's strenght as a director lies in his ability to present us with a vision.

Alright so Matthew McConaughey is an ex spaceship pilot, stumbles upon NASA cuz, you guys, the government is evil now, is recruited for a mission to save the planet by finding another planet to colonize. Plan A is to evacuate Earth and move to that planet. That plan (SPOILERS!) is a sham. The real plan is Plan B, which is to repopulate the new planet with embryos. So is Anne Hathaway going to give birth to a hundred babies? How exactly is that going to work? They save Matt Damon. He turns out to be evil and loyal to Plan B. Sets about his own doom by ignoring all warning signs that his airlock is not secure (seriously?!). Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey set sail for another planet. But Matthew McConaughey goes rogue and gets sucked into a black hole. The power of love transports him to his daughter's bedroom (?) - but IN THE PAST YOU GUYS, and he sends messages with Morse Code. Apparently transferring all of the data he's learned about...something or another...through Morse Code (that's one heck of a compression scheme), which allows his daughter to save humanity. He then gets saved from the black hole (?). Reunites with daughter on Saturn (?). And sets up the premise for the sequel. The plot isn't so much twisting and turning as it is just convulsing and flatlining. I didn't really care about any of the characters - actually Matt Damon was the most interesting.

","I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2015,westsideschl,3," A Dumbing Down Experience
","A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero.

18 September 2018,jackfull,10," A graceful duet of Sci-Fi and Reality
","Interstellar is a masterpiece of both visuals, science fiction, reality, and story. What makes this movie so good to people, is the fact of how everything is executed. 
The camera work and visuals in Interstellar use both CGI and real word environments. The water planet was not a stage, but actually a glacier in Iceland. The combination of visuals with the props, costumes, etc. are what make this film look so breathtaking. 
The Sci Fi aspect of Interstellar comes mostly into affect when Joesph Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) enters a black hole in the final minutes of the movie. This sends him to what can only be described as a different dimension, that has the ability to bridge both space and time. The nickname for this dimension (but only because it appears in a way Coop can understand and use it) is the space bookcase. The bookcase is the one in his daughter Murph's bedroom. It's here that he can see that the coordinates and things that were laid out for him on Murph's floor to get him into space in the first place was laid out for him, by him. This would constitute as a time loop, but while Interstellar does involve theoretical time physics in its plot, it does not dabble with time travel as a whole concept. This part of the movie is what falls into the Sci Fi genre, in that we don't know if something like this could actually happen. 
The Reality aspect of Interstellar actually involves most of the film as a whole. Most of the science and equations used in it are in fact, real world science. 
Lastly, the story. The story is well written, the dialogue is great, and it defines each character so that each person has their own traits and quirks. 
All in all, everything in this movie gets wrapped up into the beautiful work that is Interstellar. I would strongly suggest this movie, in that it makes you think just a little bit more.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","Amidst the stars in the galaxy known as Hollywood a deep mystery remains: who is Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker? After seeing Interstellar in IMAX, his ninth and least satisfying film, the question perpetuates. Nolan is one of the most powerful and bankable directors in the world. Together, his last four films earned nearly four billion dollars. Money builds opportunities and egos in Hollywood and consequently each entry in Nolan's filmography has grown in size and scope. Yet outside of his admiration for 35 mm film and practical effects, grasping Nolan's auteurist imprint is difficult. He says he wants to make the biggest film possible but so does Michael Bay. Nolan's films walk a difficult line, balancing large ideas and explosions, proving blockbusters don't have to be mindless.

","I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.

","I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstellar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that ""love is the only thing (a ""thing""??) which overcomes time and space"". Corny and retarded, and so very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach.

","Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time.

The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," Interstellar was indeed pretty stellar.
","Interstellar will divide the audience. Some of them will love and enjoy this movie, while others will see it as a boring film and feel the long 3 movie pace. Interstellar is no way, a popcorn fun film. It's a smart man film. It's remind me, so much of 1968's 2001: A Space Odessey, both in visuals and how people reaction to it. Both films, receive mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike. I think like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie, Interstellar will garnered a cult following and slowly became a bigger box office hit, but right now, it's up in the air. While, the movie seem to taking a lot of homage to that film, Interstellar seem grounded by the director own identification. It's a film that couldn't blast away, even if a lot of determination went into making this film. The reason is, because people have become so aware of what Director & Writer Christopher Nolan will do. Without spoiling it, too much, the movie has a lot of overused Nolanism tropes & clichés. This means a lot of exposition dialogue with characters explain through dialogue their innermost feelings, instead of, acting those emotions out. Add the elaborate, flashback-heavy narrative structure, and lots of science mucho jumbo, and you get a film that will confused people. Some people think, it is a fallacy, but in my opinion, it's not inherently bad. They're alright in the right doses. People need to be challenge in films. People need to think. If you're so caught up on Nolanisms, you'll never let yourself enjoy the film, as a whole. I think some people just didn't get it. I don't blame them, I love the film, but parts of the film are indeed slow pace, and hard to understand. Even with a love for Quantum physics, space travel and psychology before this film, I had a hard time following what's going on. Like 2001 Space Odyssey, this movie lacks the broad appeal to an audience whom unaware for a need of such deep intelligent research. Maybe, it was a bit overreaching in its direction; as the film feels less a film, a more of a science lecture. You really have to tune in; to get, most of it. The trailers were no help, coming in. The film is about a team of astronauts whom travel through a wormhole in an attempt to find a potentially habitable planet that will sustain humanity, because Earth cannot longer manage life. I found a lot of things jarring in the film, like example, how they use a Saturn like rocket to escape out of Earth's astrosphere, but later on the film, they're able to leave, most planet's upper astrosphere with ease with their little spacecraft. A major error that I have spotted is the matter of the planets where gravitational forces cause such extreme time dilation that an hour on that planet equals seven years for us on Earth. Technically, yes, it's a possible, but the gravitational forces necessary to bring this about, would be so extreme that no planet, let alone people, would survive such gravity pull. Why couldn't they go to Saturn's moons? After all, scientists have pointed out that Saturn's moon Titan possesses an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life. Save you the time, and effect. I know, everyone on Earth has infinite resources, despite large blight dust-clouds, but come on! The movie felt like two movies, mixed together. I think the first half of the film movie is very Sci-fiction, with the second half of the film after the wormhole, a bit Sci-fantasy, because how much, it lacks true science. Even if we can make a wormhole, the equations show that they're unstable and they would collapse upon you if you tried to go through. So, that's where the science fiction comes in. Kip Thorne put an amazing amount of research into the film, but the film does have some moments that you might have to suspend your disbelief in. I'm glad, the second half is that way, because it got really boring in the first half of the film. Way too much talking into the first part of the film. Most of the action and tense moments, play out in the second part. One of the biggest fears in the film is Einstein's special theory of relativity. I think the problem of relativity, played very well in the film as characters are afraid of wasting time. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, the former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer is a great role for him. I love the tense relationship with him, and his daughter, Murph played by Mackenzie Foy (Age 11) & Jessica Chastain (Age 37). You really see the pain that Cooper goes through, when he sees his children, growing up fast in front of him. While the ending is very clunky, it was very emotionally and physically draining to watch. Indeed, Matthew could act. He was the anchor that kept the story, grounded. Still, it was bit a stretch, at times, hard to believe, that his character spend most of his later life, farming, but still able to be an accurate ace pilot who can play a spacecraft through black holes, and dock on spinning out of control space station. Jessica Chastain is great in the secondary role. Anne Hathaway, while overacting in her role as Brand, Coop's co-explorer; was mostly alright, despite her character, doing a lot of stupid selfish things. The rest of the supporting cast were pretty good with their parts. I do love the smart ass robots. I thought the visuals were amazing. Must watch on IMAX. I thought the music by Han Zimmer was absolutely beautiful and really made the dramatic scenes including the end scene with the twist all the more engaging. Still, it was overbearing, and the sound mixer were pretty bad as I couldn't hear the dialogue, when the music is playing. Overall: Despite its faults, it's a good movie.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2014,trublu215,6," A visually epic film
","Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

Moreover, it really is the first movie that really explained the four dimensions of space and time to me in utterly breathtaking fashion. Nolan really managed to make astronomy interesting again and in a world where education is becoming undervalued, inspires us to grow and learn. The movie is filled to the brim with dialogues and lessons that everyone can learn from and understand.

(1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Avatar (2009), Minority Report (2002), Gravity (2013), The Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and all three of the Iron Man movies (2008-2013). Out of all the movies that I just listed it reminds me of Grvity when it comes to the emotions of the characters but this movie telling more of a story, and as well as 2001 when it comes to the visuals.The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a farmer whose daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy)notice that there is drought and famine that leads to dust storms and then they are led to NASA where they will meet a man named Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) who convinces Cooper to go on the mission to save earth and he then agrees to it but hates the feeling of leaving his children behind without seeing them grow up for many years but luckily they have their grandfather (played by John Lithgow) who watches them for the rest of his life. Christopher Nolan's direction and his script (co-written by his brother Jonathan Nolan) are just perfect for the movie to have, and not only that but even Hans Zimmer's suspenseful score is amazing. At this past Oscars ceremony this movie got 5 well deserved Oscar nominations but the only Oscar that it went off with was for visual effects when I think it deserved a whole lot more in my personal opinion. Even the cast delivers great and top notch performances not only from McConaughey, Caine, and Lithgow, but also from Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo as the principal that his kids went to school to, William Devane (who appears on the Rosland Capital commercials) and one of the people who work at NASA, Matt Damon, Topher Grace, and David Gyasi as one of the crew members on the mission.

","Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess.

","This movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it. First off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days, with what I assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was. When a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a Ken Burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way. We have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and I say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be, unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of Morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe. The second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon, space and beyond. Anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked. The last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when Mathew Mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bed,only to chase him out of the room. Then there are the million questions that don't add up, there is no army any more, LOL like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had. Mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie, where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn, and where did NASA come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no US government to build all this crap? Its a known fact that the scientists at NASA built not a darn thing nor ever have, its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them. NASA does not so much as put one bolt in one hole. Micheal Cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning.

The writing is scientifically accurate and well defines the Murph family, but everyone else is given typical Nolan characteristics, in that there too serious to have a personality.

11 November 2014,rrcharpe,2," Bad movie made worse by IMDb over-rating!
","Unlike the majority of the viewers of this film commenting on IMDb I found it flat,unrealistic in the extreme and essentially another Hollywood dud. Many times the people who make these Sci-Fi films will literally flood the IMDb review section with positive reviews, causing the IMDb rating to go up and (they probably hope) causing more people to go see the movie. What disappointed me the most about this movie were the obvious scientific inaccuracies and distortions that made watching it more of a leap of faith rather than an exciting trip into mankind's future. As most people know (adults of course) is that there is no such thing as a ""stable"" wormhole. That premise was used ad infinitum by Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and just as lamely since there is ""no such thing"" as stability when discussing wormholes. Additionally, the ending made essentially no sense whatsoever. What else can I say except skip it unless you love gigantic bulging eyes crying all the time (Anne Hathaway) or checking out Matthew M's pecks. There was very little entertainment in the movie that's for sure. StocktonRob",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2014,therocksbarneyreviews,8," One of Nolan's best, but watch out Chris.
","""Interstellar"" is truly an epic, not in the sense of what we initially think of as an epic, for example ""Ben Hur"" or perhaps even ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a film which it is worth pointing out I haven't seen), but more in the sense of how when I think back to ""Interstellar"", I think of those visually captivating shots of black, of the unknown and of those desolate landscapes made of water and ice, and how I found myself in awe of them. It is these that come to define ""Interstellar"". Set in the near future, Earth cannot sustain humanity anymore, and it's worth praising Nolan's subtle view of it, be it seeing the New York Yankees playing on an amateur field or discovering that the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union, which Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) denies. This scene, whilst allowing for a sense of character development in regards to Cooper, in retrospect seems to be Nolan emphasising how he sticks to the traditional elements of film and he does so more than ever in this film, from building several rooms of a spaceship from scratch to using five industrial fans to create a dust storm, thus attributing even more of the credit for the film to him. Yet as I expected, it proves very difficult for members of this all- star cast to break through both the visually stunning shots and the label of Christopher Nolan, and be noticed. Only McConaughey succeeds in doing so, although Mackenzie Foy (playing a young Murphy) and Bill Irwin (voicing the robot, TARS) deserve mentions, as does to an extent Michael Caine (playing Professor Brand) and his recital of Dylan Thomas' ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"", although I still don't entirely understand its inclusion, leaving big names such as Casey Affleck (playing Tom) and even Jessica Chastain (playing Murphy) ""down in the dirt"". Interstellar is a quintessentially Nolan film, meant to be seen on IMAX, imposing those classic Nolan themes of love and family whilst asking questions that I have not seen asked before, in this case winding up the scientists, although it is interesting to note that Nolan answers them by playing with several theories, instead of just getting the science completely wrong, as is so common. Yet the film is so Nolan that it takes that extra unnecessary step that Nolan always has present in his work, be it taking the audience to Limbo in Inception or by adding the twist of Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard) turning out to be Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises. Before I conclude, I think it is important to make this point in regards to Nolan and his (future) works. He has begun, whether he means it or not, to dwarf his own cast and to an extent his own themes and his commitment to traditional film elements. The amount of hype that goes into his films is widespread and if he isn't careful, his future works could take a turn for the worse. As I have already said, Nolan always takes that extra unnecessary step, one that I don't think I would be so sympathetic with if it was another director, yet the brilliance of what comes before it makes up for it, often leaving me in that No Man's Land of whether the film was worth 9 or 10 stars.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is dull and boring and well just forgettable. I imagine by the time I finish this review I will have forgotten most of the film. I will never see it twice. Even people that enjoyed it I would wager they don't rush for a second viewing. Probably most likely only sit through it a second time after 20 years forgetting they'd even seen it. Most talked about the visuals and the sounds. like all Nolan's movies it's big bass and looks good on the eye but unlike Inception this is overly indulgent complicated for the sake of it. The main story behind all the space talk is basically would you spend a life time with your family or give that up and save mankind's race? Answer screw mankind. In the film it's save mankind. As always Hollywood think's humans have a moral compass and we'd all give up our kids for the good of the race. We as humans would not. I would not and proud to say it. My kids come first before all of mankind. Anyone that thinks differently either doesn't have kids or is lying to themselves. And when a movie shows this , I straight away think this main character just left his family behind..what an ass. The film would have been a lot better if it just became what was the only interesting part of it. Rescuing astronauts on new planets. Those parts was the only time I thought cool new planet with stranded person on it this should be interesting. And we got 2 planets and 1 person (Matt Damon) What a pity. Damon was the only person that actually brought the film alive and then he was gone.Damn. Could go through all the space mumble jumble but really can't be bothered. It's duller than watching grass grow. I Like Nolan sometimes but sometimes he goes too far and loses his way(The Dark Knight Rises springs too mind). This film gets way too much credit from loyal fans of his, its up there with his worst movies he's made and I hope he knows it. It's the only way he'l return to making great ones if he see's his mistakes. So to sum up. Dull boring story/way overly complicated/characters no one cares about and by the end your left thinking damn I just lost all that time out of my life and there's no way to bend time to get it back.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison.

9 November 2014,jjanerney,10," Incredible cinema
","Lets start by saying that i was astonished by Nolan's vision, mesmerized by the visual, captivated by the plot and touched by the characters. Having waited 11 months for this film and being a huge fan of Nolan perhaps i am not able to provide an objective opinion about this film, but all i can say is that delivered what i wanted and far more. It was astonishing. So lets start with the cinematography, and as usual with Nolan's films it looks pristine. There was no shot misplaced, the tone presented by the camera movements was perfect. Every movement had a purpose and there was no unnecessary 'fluff,' hand-held cameras are used extensively and this gave the film a very pure feel. That being said there were certain scenes were our jaw will just drop. This is partly because of Nolan's genius use of the camera and also partly because he only uses practical effects which made the entire film feel far more real and tangible. The acting in this film is fantastic, the entire sequence between Coop and his daughter at the start of the film is genuinely heart wrenching and incredibly well done by both actors, and throughout the film the acting never once becomes wooden. A quick mention to Hans Zimmer for the most incredible score that held together the film and added so much to the feeling of uncertainty, not once has Zimmer made a bad score and i feel that this is his best score yet. Onto the point of Nolan's films the core focus and what drives the plot is family. Throughout the film i feel Nolan is saying that through this journey mankind is 'evolving'(too say any more would spoil the film) and throughout the film there is a sense that every misstep makes the characters better and smarter. Throughout the entire film some characters constantly say 'we did this i theory but it is completely different in reality' which i feel shows that as the movie progress so do the characters in terms of knowledge and understanding and by the end of the film some even seem like they are a 'higher being.' However throughout the film none of these high concepts feel like they are out of reach or that the film is impossible to relate to because throughout the film the one thing that holds it together is love and family and unbreakable relationships and this remains a touchstone throughout the film that everyone can relate to and understand the film. Let me say this now, although it appears to resemble 2001 I do not believe that it does. 2001 is a very clinical detached film which in my opinion is the greatest film ever, this film is very different. It may be an incredible space Odyssey but unlike 2001 it has 'blood in its veins' and perhaps Interstellar becomes too sentimental at points and it compromises the plot because of it but i feel like this is the point of the film. Nolan wanted to make an epic journey that could be related to(I would argue that 2001 is the greatest film ever but that it is difficult to grasp because of the clinical nature of it). Nolan definitely did this with Interstellar, it is a film that can be grasped and interpreted and related to, but he also made a tremendously epic film that i not simple and tackles subject matter that many directors before have struggled to even get a grasp on themselves never mind convey it in a film so grand. Is this the greatest film ever, o, but it is definitely up there and the fact that a film so complex is the largest film event of the year shows that the audiences that go in their droves to see this film aren't that stupid either. To conclude I salute Christopher Nolan for this film, it was pure incredible film making the lime of which i haven't seen in years, the fact that all i have thought about since the screening is this film and that even after 3 hours I still felt like there should be more shows in my opinion just how great a film this is. This is the best film i have seen in many years and it is my opinion Nolan's crowning work, there has not been a film this ambitious and with this complex a vision made so well since 2001. I will end as I started, incredible cinema.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I first saw previews of the movie, I thought it looked really sappy and unappealing. But then I saw it was a Christopher Nolan movie and I thought it had to be good. I love all his movies: Batman, The Prestige, INCEPTION. He's made so many great movies, I thought there was no way it could be that bad... well it was.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

However, there is a smaller group of people who say that while Nolan is a talented director, he's not the film making genius that fans make him out to be.

19 March 2021,JoelChamp85,10," They Captured A Dream
","Beyond a well made and amazing VFX space exploration film, Interstellar captures one of the closest efforts to a real dream projected on screen I've ever seen. If your parents pass away at a young age, and that's how you forever remember them, then in your dreams you would only see them at that age. Even when you become old and grey, and you surpass their dying age, you would continue dreaming of them as young adult. This film really captured that for me. Plus the great performances of the actors and intense soundtrack really sells it.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie made me wish I was both deaf and blind. Blind, so I wouldn't have to see it, and deaf so that I wouldn't have to hear the soundtrack, which was like having nails pounded into your skull with a hammer. I will now have to plug my headphones into my iPhone and play a few Motley Crue songs just to get the sludge out of my brain. This gets 2 out of 10 only because some of the acting (and overacting) was good, so the actors get some credit here. Lots of boo-hooey scenes of astronauts crying over this and that, the soundtrack being relentlessly over-dramatic and so was everything else. This is the sort of film where you could take all the characters and blow them up with an atom bomb, and you would find yourself cheering at the end. Honestly, two hours of Beavis and Butt-Head reruns would be a vast improvement over this movie.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv
1 February 2021,dr_clarke_2,10," A film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish
","Having dabbled with earth-bound science fiction in The Prestige and Inception, 2014's Interstellar saw director Christopher Nolan turn his hand to space-opera. Set in a not-too-distant future in which mankind's crops are failing, the film sees a group of astronauts headed by Matthew McConaughey's Cooper set out through a wormhole in search of a new planet for humanity to colonise. Naturally, they face difficulties, but not of the aliens and space-battle kind; Interstellar provides it characters with more scientifically plausible threats.
As well as directing Interstellar, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan, and it's a characteristically cerebral affair. This is science fiction that had a theoretical physicist as a scientific advisor and the challenges it presents include the effects of relativity, as Cooper's likelihood of ever seeing his children again grows ever more remote, and the gravitational forces of black holes. The story's scale is broad and deep, and is weighty not just in scientific terms, but also philosophical ones, the script musing extensively on the nature and power of love. At the same time, the first part of the film - set in an entirely recognisable near-future American dust-bowl - grounds the film in reality, and by taking the time to explore Cooper's relationship with his daughter Murphy it also provides it with an emotional heart. The film isn't entirely bereft of action however, thanks to the treachery of Matt Damon's Mann, a scientist who realises that his own survival matters to him more than that of mankind's.
The film unfolds relatively sedately over two and three quarter hours, but rather like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is a film so visually beautiful that it's easy to just sit and drink in the spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and so are the sets. There's an internal consistency to the design of the technology that is speaks of great attention to detail, and the novel blocky design of TARS and CASE is ingenious. The film marks cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's first collaboration with Nolan and he does a superb job, not just of the outer space sequences, but also during the location filming, which makes effective use of the panoramic vistas of the Canadian landscape the scenes were shot in to create an impression of a sickly, ailing world. Innovative use of hand-held cameras also helps to emphasise the claustrophobia of the space ship sets and nauseating dizziness of zero gravity. The astonishing visual are complemented by the soundtrack provided by regular Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, which perfectly captures the dramatic but often melancholy atmosphere of the story.
The casting of Matthew McConaughey as Cooper proves to be a masterstroke, as he gives an astonishingly naturalistic and at times emotionally charged performance, especially during Cooper's scenes with Murphy. He leads an impressive cast for an impressive film, and everyone is perfectly suited to his or her role, including Anne Hathaway as Amelia Brand, Matt Damon as the treacherous Mann, and Jessica Chastain as Murphy. Smaller roles are taken by the likes of John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Wes Bentley and Casey Affleck, and they all get under their characters' skins. This being a Christopher Nolan film, Michael Caine also appears, as aging scientist Professor Brand, and he brings quiet dignity to the character.
For all of the film's scientific credentials, Interstellar isn't a documentary: the film's lengthy denouement inside the tesseract takes the story into the realms of pure fantasy, and results in a fairytale happy ending that somehow manages to compliment the theoretical physics of the middle section. There's no reason why it shouldn't: it's an approach that worked for Stanley Kubrick and whilst inviting comparison (even unintentionally) to 2001: A Space Odyssey is asking for trouble, Interstellar compares well. It is a film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish; Christopher Nolan has yet to make a bad film, but it seems distinctly possibly that this one will come to be regarded as his best.",/review/rw4020992/?ref_=tt_urv
