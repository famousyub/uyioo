","I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",/review/rw6054662/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Actually it got better for me
","Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.",/review/rw0436349/?ref_=tt_urv

I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack.

","I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see.""

The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

11 January 2015,CalRhys,," Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning
","James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version.

9 August 1998,Rage-4,," bravo
","Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron.

The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On.

14 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!
","When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch.

","This movie truly broke my heart. Jack and Rose face great difficulties (her being an aristocrat and him poor) but they still continue to fight fo their love no matter what. We first see an old lady which we later on know is Rose. She sees on the TV the drawing of her that Jack had made when thenews was talking about the Titanic shipwreck. She then goes on to call the news and tell her story.84 years ago on April 10th 1912, 17 year old Rose is on board on the Titanic ship along with her mom, grandma, and fiance, Caledon, (all of who'm were nobelty/aristocrats). Rose feels helpessly trapped by her situation ( marrying her snobby fiancé, Caledon) and tries to commit suicide by hanging off the edge of the deck until she was rescued by Jack. Jack is then invited by Caledon to a dinner amongst the rich in return for his heroic action. He goes through the evening acting his best at being rich. Jack then takes Rose down to the third-classe's party, where they dance endlessly. Shockingly, one of CaLedon's spies had followed them and informed him of his fiance's sneaking around. Rose was intruiged by Jack's drawings and so she asks him to draw her nude wearing the diamond necklace Caledon gave her. Caledon finds out and had plotted against Jack, he falsely accussed him of theft and had him locked away. Not long after, the ship encounters an iceberg which threatens to wreck it apart. Panic overflows the ship as the crew/staff takes safety precautions, giving people life vests. Soon, the lower parts of the ship begin to drown. Jack is in danger and so Rose is in panic to rescue him from the room in which he is in chains in. She manages to get an axe and breaks the chains. The water was almost head-level. They both swim upwards and get to the top of the ship. Boats were getting filled up, women and children going first. Caledon ushers Rose to go in, promising her that Jack was going to be safe. She doesn't believe him and returns back for Jack. Caledon, furious, chases after Jack and Rose with a gun in his hand. Fortunately all his shots miss and they manage to escape to the top of the ship. Caledon soon fakes having a child in order to board a boat. At this point, the Titanic's end was titing upwards at an extreme angles, people were falling off whilst others were lucky enough to clang onto stuff. Jack and Rose hold on to the top of the ship and get ready to dive into the deep, freezing water. Fortunately, Rose;s life vest allowed her to swim a bit more easily, can not say the same for Jck though. Rose clings onto a wooden boards whilst Jack is barely holds on to it. They pass out and by the time help comes, it was way too late... Jack had frozen to death. Unknowing of that fact, Rose tries to shake him awake until she comes into the shocking realization. Jack drops t the deep ocean, his corpse becoming a part of the ocean. She is then rescued by the crew and taken back. All the survivors from the Titanic are saved by the RMS Carpathia.",/review/rw8473502/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",/review/rw3734734/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2019,nirome,10," Timeless and epic masterpiece
","On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",/review/rw4736763/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",/review/rw0436921/?ref_=tt_urv

","James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it.

","There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship.

The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box.

","I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there.

","In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",/review/rw8746363/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",/review/rw3111433/?ref_=tt_urv

Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie.

","James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments.

I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",/review/rw5306826/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.",/review/rw1664503/?ref_=tt_urv

The fictional story of two main actors was absolutely beautiful. Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.

DiCaprio saw the role's potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here. Winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career. Give this one a try and see if you like it.

25 January 2019,imdb-58910,10," My favorite film
","I absolutely like this movie! It is the best romantic drama, fantastic direct, gripping music, very good actors, beautiful story... great combination that predestines good results. The film stars Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson).
The story is about young lover were so different world. Rose is very rich girl. She is engagement with rich man- Caledon Hockley. Rose is unhappy, she must leave to New York to she could get married in NYC. They travel in upper-class with her mother Ruth. Jack and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. Rose want kill herself. Jack- poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship. Lovers met and love story started...
This story always inspiring me and I often thinking about this film, this story. About lifes a thousand people, about ,,Ship of dream""
My opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved. Titanic is about this.
You will certainly give me the truth when I write that Titanic is very moving.

21 May 2011,nickmesafilms,10," Titanic (1997) - I'm the King of the World!!!!!!!!!!!
","Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. ""Titanic"", in my review, ""a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.""",/review/rw2431676/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,guskeller,9," Pop culture perfection
","Titanic is pop culture perfection. It's everything wide audiences crave and has elite craft. Even the writing (its weakest aspect) is fair. The love story is generic, but it's efficient and accents the dramatic disaster. In some ways, that romance is just right because the setting is already complex. More nuance could've overly complicated the film. Sometimes, simplicity is not only desired by audiences, but also required by circumstances. Meanwhile, the acting is quality. Leo is fine, Winslet is great, and the supporting cast is strong. All together, this provides the ideal amount of emotional investment to synergize with Titanic's grand spectacle.",/review/rw7847274/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw a dismal film ahead, when I first saw the opening credits, but it was still entertaining, and a little tragic.  In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn't believe.  The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling!  Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette?  I felt spent, and that's typical of Cameron movies too.  If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he'd have a twenty minute crucifixion scene.  The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off.  Oh well, Cameron's not much without his special effects here, but that's what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows.  James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies.  I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were.  This movie?  I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny.  The sinking is what this movie's about. Rating: 7/10 (Bill Paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie)",/review/rw0436305/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 1999,curtis-8,," ""A Night to Remember 3""
","I liked ""Titanic"". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, ""A Night to Remember"" (also a book, and a previous film). And I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism. Rent the 1958 version of ""A Night to Remember"", watch it, and tell me I'm wrong.",/review/rw0437025/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor.

","While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him.

","I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!).

11 June 2016,Rueiro,3," Titanic: the parody
","This film is so full of absurdities and clichés that it is to all the previous Titanic films what ""Airplane"" is to the ""Airport"" saga and ""Blazing Saddles"" is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of ""But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!"" He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling ""I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will"" And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"" The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",/review/rw3486019/?ref_=tt_urv

Leonardo DiCaprio was born for the role of Jack Dawson, he makes the audience fall in love with him rapidly, and not just because of his looks. Kate Winslet represents well the role of a young girl in need of freedom. Everything about the movie was outstanding. The setting is a very similar replica too the actual RMS Titanic.

","One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancé, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. ★★★★ 4 stars.",/review/rw2452813/?ref_=tt_urv

But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding ""DiCraprio"" was just icing on the cake for him.

15 September 1999,Tommy-92,7," Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good
","Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",/review/rw0437046/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2005,thatsweetbird,1," Best Picture?????????
","Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",/review/rw1033328/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic (1997): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton: It became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise. A drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the Titanic and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy. Director James Cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as The Terminator and Aliens. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who steers Kate Winslet away from a potential suicide. She is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle. They fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger. Predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship. DiCaprio and Winslet are basically Romeo and Juliet under different names. Billy Zane is embarrassing as her jealous fiancé who scowls and pursues them with a gun. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers. Huge achievement for Cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it.

","I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",/review/rw0436815/?ref_=tt_urv

","There isn't much to say about this film other than incredible. A true epic masterpiece. I admit to seeing it five time in the theater an countless times since then. Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichéd as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece.

23 May 2000,Covey-3,," Oi, Cameron. No.
","The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.",/review/rw0437247/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into the Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story. But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted.

","It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling ""all right"" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me.

","Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.",/review/rw0437019/?ref_=tt_urv

","There has been nothing similar before and it's hard to imagine something like titanic will ever be created that masterfully & epic again.
I will not respond to any low ratings and leave these viewers alone with their well, opinion. To me TITANIC is the definition of perfection. It came to the absolutely right time. Maybe a few years earlier or later the impact to society would have been less big or even bigger? anyway it influenced a whole generation and even a decade later it has not lost a single spark. It's still the one and only benchmark for any movie. Titanic inspires young and old, brings everyone with a heart to tears and impresses with the highest level of detail in movie making. I'm so thankful I was part of the premiere and the re-screening.
Titanic delivers the perfect 10 on all levels. The attention to detail, eg the dishes and furniture have been all recreated 1:1 to the original. The cast, Katy Bates & esp Kate Winslet (who, in my opinion was shockingly robbed to win her 1st academy award. Alone for heart breaking deleted scene where she had a mental breakdown was one of the best performances by any actress !) and then of course the score: haunting & epic. Recognizable under millions of other melodies including the modern classic my heart will go on.

","""Titanic"",like ""Gone with the wind"" is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so ""Titanic"" repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a ""great"" movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even ""opportunist"" might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and ""Titanic"" has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the ""buts"" and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clichés one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched ""Titanic"" six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry.

","I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.",/review/rw2623116/?ref_=tt_urv

","This may contain spoilers...... OK just a little bit of background to this review. Firstly, yes I was one of that 0.01% who did not see this movie at the cinemas when it came out. Secondly, when I did see it for the first time on TV last year, I missed the first 45 minutes. However, I saw enough of this movie to see how ridiculously over-rated it was. Firstly, the positives, and there weren't a whole lot. Number one: yes, the special effects were as good as they were supposed to be. The design of the Titanic was amazing. Also the bit at the end where the ship sinks was incredible. Number two: Kate Winslet has a nice body, and you do get to see a lot more of it than I thought you would...... although one could be a bit cynical about that scene, that they only put it in to get more people to watch it. That's about it for the positives. Now for the negatives: Leonardo Di Caprio can't really act. OK, I thought he did well in Romeo and Juliet (which is one of my favorite movies) but his acting and dialog are just really wooden in Titanic. The characters as a whole are just one-dimensional. One of the most laughable points was though how many life-or-death situations there are for Leo and Kate in the last hour (yes, the movie takes forever to finish). First Leonardo gets locked down below deck as the water level slowly rises (ooh will he survive????) and of course gets rescued by Kate Winslet after about 15 minutes. Then Kate's evil fiancée (yes not much room for development in that character) starts shooting at them so they have to run back 5 levels deep before deciding to go back on top. Here they face a literal ""class barrier"" (big metaphor there of course) a big iron gate, which, with help from the other battling workers, Leonardo bravely breaks down. Forgive my sarcasm, but it was hard not to roll my eyes throughout this whole sequence. Then after narrowly surviving half a dozen near-death experiences, Leonardo dies in the lamest way possible. Instead of attempting to find another piece of debris to float on in the water, he rather unnecessarily lets winslet have the whole piece of wood to float on, and lets himself freeze to death. But perhaps the worst part of all was the sequences where we go back to the old 101-year old version of Kate Winslet telling the story, with a bunch of young scientists passing social commentary on it. I've always hated this idea, because it gives away the ending of the film. The viewer knows that she will survive, and Leonardo won't. Which sort of takes away from any of the suspense. Anyhow, I would recommend this movie to anyone (not that you haven't seen it already) but go in with a low expectation and you might find it a decent film. Certainly don't watch it, though, expecting to see a film that deserved 11 Oscars, cos you will be disappointed.",/review/rw1042760/?ref_=tt_urv

This is the first movie I have ever experienced in a stadium seating setting. Titanic is historic for many reasons. Honestly, I wasn't too familiar with the sinking of the Titanic. For me, experiencing this film at that time was, and will always be a game changer for cinema. I grew up watching cable TV, so I have seen many movies, but nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see in Titanic. It was one of the best experiences I've ever had in a movie theater, and although it was mostly packed, the people were into it. I'd say about the last hour and 25 minutes, I was in tears. The scene that did it for me was when Jack says to Rose, ""Why did you do that?! Why?!"" as they frantically embrace one another while next to the bottom of the staircase after she jumped back onto the ship. From there, I was a blubbering mess. Never seen anything like it. I was glad to see it in 3D when it was rereleased back in 2012.

The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears.",/review/rw2138118/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie,""Titanic"", has great moments in it such as the dramatic sinking of the ship with all the intense desperation that event brought about in the crew and passengers as they struggled to live. There is no denying that movie has appealed to audiences around the world. Titanic fever has once again hit young and old and I'm sure books produced about this tragedy would have sold well. My frustration with the movie was not the special effects which were brilliant but rather the way in which the two main characters, Jack and Rose, acted in the movie. It was almost as if the two characters had hopped into a time machine and magically appeared on the deck of the Titanic behaving just as they would have done in our era. Who really would have tolerated the activities of Jack and Rose as they moved about the ship in such a free and easy way? The strict manners of 1912 were not the easy manners of our era. I for one did not shed a tear when Jack went under the water in 1912 as I would have done if he had drowned today (because today he would have been at least a real person of our time). The Jack in this movie is so out of place and time (and Rose is too liberated in her behaviour for that era - really the love scene in the car is a laugh a minute). The real heroes of the Titanic were the crew who sacrificed their lives for the safety of the passengers, the poorer passengers who lost their lives because of the preference given to the rich in allotting spaces on the lifeboats and those men who bravely remained behind to let their wives and children get onto the few lifeboats available. Fictional characters such as Jack and Rose simply created to appeal to a late 20th century audience do these real heroes of 1912 a great disservice. ""Titanic"" is a movie to see because of its special effects but it is hardly memorable in its presentation of its lead characters.",/review/rw0436451/?ref_=tt_urv

","I cannot for the love of God, believe how extremely OVERRATED James 
 Cameron's pile of garbage known as Titanic is! This film, which should 
 have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship Titanic, 
 instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to ""carry"" the picture 
 through. IF the two main characters had been interesting, it might have 
 been a better picture, but, alas, the two leads, Jack Dawson, and Rose 
 Bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry. Rose isn't 
 suffering from oppression, she's suffering from SPOILED BRAT syndrome! 
 Jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling 
 character that the audience relates to.
 
 The film does have a few assets such as costume design, and some of the 
 special effects are pretty good. However, it's the whole script and 
 it's 90210 meets the Titanic setting that makes this the most OVERRATED 
 film in the history of motion pictures! This film grossed $600 million 
 in the United States?!?! James Cameron must have put mind altering 
 drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and 
 academy members who gave this stinker Best Picture of 1997 over the 
 great L.A. Confidential.

","Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I've now seen every film he's directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they're all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn't one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he's yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don't blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that's what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term ""grandiose"" when applied to that aspect; the reason we ""feel"" it, though, is that we care about the ones we ""know"" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not ""just a wife"", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can't hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that's up to the individual to judge; I wouldn't say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer.

","Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns.

","Disaster movies might be my favorite genre. There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I've also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don't watch it as often as I did because I'm starting to really dislike the first half.

31 July 2005,PWNYCNY,8," Even though the ship sank, it's still a very good movie
","Titanic is Hollywood's biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason - it is a great movie. This movie is about sacrifice, selflessness, love, devotion, joy, passion, all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks, resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl, Rose, barely a teenager, who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal, a nasty, brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fiancé. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose, by nature a gentle spirit, is angry and desperate to escape, so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man, Jack, who, despite his shabby appearance, is a well-traveled, sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him, and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love, the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose, instead of cashing it in like she could have, she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed, the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive, unhappy, moody adolescent into a composed, mature, independent and beautiful woman, even changing her name, now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is, she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack, he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly, knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live. That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with Christian teachings.",/review/rw1139531/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",/review/rw2080031/?ref_=tt_urv

The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I'll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though.

","It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron's ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship's officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn't it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90's so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don't we (can't make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord's incomparable book on the disaster ""A Night to Remember"", and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it's 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated ""blockbuster"". And those who glibly call this ""the best movie of all time"" are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Spartacus"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"". ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""Patton"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Quiet Man""....",/review/rw0436854/?ref_=tt_urv

The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins.

","Voice of Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci: ""Sam, Ziggy says you've leapt into one Jack Dawson of Chippewa Falls,Michigan and that there's a 78.5% chance that you're here to save the life of one Rose Dewitt Bukater."" Well, at least that's the way I see it. I may not see Scott Bakula or Stockwell, but for some reason I get the feeling that behind DeCaprio's pretty boy looks, it is Bakula as time-traveler Sam Beckett pulling his strings. I can just hear Stockwell after the nude drawing: ""You drew that while she was.....And I missed it?! Rats!!"" Back to the movie, it may be a chick flick for girls to see Leo, but it does have Kate Winslet for the guys. She looks incredible with red hair! Billy Zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays (maybe it comes naturally) and David Warner should get the Jerk Reward for his portrayal as Zane's stooge. Exceptionally talented Kathy Bates is wonderfully likeable as Molly Brown, a far cry from her ""Misery"" role, but then she does excellant work in everything she does. Cameron pays a lot of detail into this work, or not considering the bloopers constantly being nick-picked.

I haven't seen him since ""Wierd Science."" The sinking is very well done.

12 May 2012,d-l-polonsky,1," The Blandest, Stupidest Account Possible of One of the Biggest Disasters in History
","The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, ""You seem more like an indoor girl."" Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case.

9 November 2000,chrisbrown6453,10," No matter how awful the situation may seem, beauty always has a way of showing itself; if even for a short time.
","Titanic opens with Brock Lovett (Paxton) and his crew as they begin to dive down 12,500 feet to the wreckage of the R.M.S. Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912.  The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day.  That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from. While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love.  While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose.  Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fiancé, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. 	Of the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character.  When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.'  She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage.  When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him.  It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man.  Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch' to a caring, lovable woman. We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait. 	 Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict.  The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it's very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience.  Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack?  Tragic. 	The greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others.  This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape.  The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality.  We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace.  The necklace ultimately represents Roses' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life.  Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep. 	As with many of James Cameron's films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy.  A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose.  Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and/or music in his films.  A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside. 	The film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending.  The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending. 	Titanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron.  While Titanic's photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist.   The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such. 	As I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey.  It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore.  Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose' and `Southampton' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was.

20 December 2009,the-gossip-king,10," Cameron's MASTERPIECE!
","For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.",/review/rw2177251/?ref_=tt_urv
27 July 2019,StonedMagician,9," Excellent: 9.5
","So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn't have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I'm sure I am overlooking some, that's about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the ""present"" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won't, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship's population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies ""the better half."" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron's signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron's work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven't yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources.",/review/rw5021219/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is probably the best example of a critic's grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clichéd and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I'm speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it's good, and I don't mean just that song you all know. James Horner's score is actually very good, part of his list of great works.",/review/rw1793684/?ref_=tt_urv

One can see why Leo became a heartthrob after this film came out- he is very good. Jim Cameron has a passion for the Ocean and he seems right at home directing Titanic.

The plot itself was one of the weakest of 1997, the leads were cardboard characters and the dialogue made me want to get up and slap them all crazy. The computer generated graphics were so obvious, esp. when they did overhead shots of the ship sailing through the ocean (polygon people anyone?). Still however there are always good sides to every bad thing, and the sinking of the ship was a feast for the eyes. It was almost like you were there! The details on the whole were very accurate and the costumes were gorgeous. The ending was very sad, and gave a human face to the tragedy, but it didn't erase the first three-quarters.

1 December 2006,chrisbishop5000,10," The most breathtaking love story ever! MUCH better than ""Gone With The Wind""
","This film is underrated and yet so beautiful! In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn't put me off. I think the certificate should've been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn't like them at all and she's also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can't put up with being somebody she doesn't want, she bolts out of Titanic's main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she's doing and insists that she doesn't drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren't sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she's engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of ""Titanic"". He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she's flying and at that point they kiss. It's shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it's just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack ""Jack when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you!"", sadly, what I say is ""you mean IF the ship docks!"" and from there all the tragedy of Titanic's collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack's is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, ""I always win, Jack"" - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that's also too emotional to be true. But there's more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after ""the ship's arse snaps"" as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it's too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. ""You have got to promise me that you'll survive, that you'll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you'll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise."" He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there's a boat to save them - but he doesn't answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I'll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, ""Titanic"" is irresistible. Over 15s won't be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive ""Gone with the Wind"". Rose may be feisty but she's certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag!

","To begin with, I liked James Cameron as a director. As a matter of fact, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie. Throughout the 80's and mid 90's James Cameron could do no wrong, then it happened: Christmas 1997 James Cameron released the most overrated, over-hyped piece of garbage that the world has ever known: Titanic! I don't buy for a second, that Cameron cared about the real tragedy, the victims, or the heroes! I firmly believe that Cameron's sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet! Critics praised it as a masterpiece, Teen and preteen girls swooned, and before you knew it, this rancid, vomit inducing, cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time! Before I begin, let me just clarify one thing: I don't hate this movie because it was a hit, I hate this movie for much more than that! So the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the Titanic. They're searching for something, but we don't know what that exactly is yet. They find an old safe, and decide to bring it up to the surface. They cheer, pop champagne bottles, and celebrate that they've found what they've been looking for. However, once the safe is opened, they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace. Some time later, a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters' expedition. An old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing, contacts the leader of the expedition, and they bring her to where they are. We find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace, and that she is the woman in the drawing. So the film then goes into her story, and to sum it all up, we get the same old cliché-ridden love story, we've all seen before! Two people from two different worlds fall in love, and everything is working against their union. Some of you out there might be thinking that I hate this movie because I'm a guy, and generally, guys hate love stories. but that's not the case. I liked the movie Moulin Rouge, and I loved the movie The Notebook. The difference between those movies and this movie is: They actually did something NEW with that basic plot! Unlike Titanic, in which the only thing ""new"" is that that it happens on the Titanic. In the story, we meet characters that have the names of real people. These people include: Captain E.J. Smith, Designer Thomas Andrews, Builder Bruce Ismay, Crewman William Murdoch, and passengers, John Jacob Astor and ""The Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. Do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them? NO! These Characters are nothing more than plot devices! THIS, is the reason why I hate this movie! It is an insult to these people's family and memory to portray them this way! Specifically, William Murdoch's and Molly Brown's. In reality, these people were heroes! In this film however, Molly Brown is used as a comic relief, and William Murdoch, is made into a villain! James Cameron, How dare you!! In 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released, and everyone hated it. People have said that the movie was poorly written, the plot was horribly cliché, and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy. What people fail to realize is: This is exactly what Titanic was! Why is Pearl Harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage, while a few years earlier, Titanic did the EXACT same thing and it's labeled a masterpiece! If you're going to hold Michael Bay's feet to the fire for Pearl Harbor, you might as well do the same to James Cameron. I know a lot of people still love this movie, and that's fine, to each their own.

Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible.

","Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie ""Titanic"" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die.

I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film.

Titanic was a romance with a story that has been told before, too many times to count.  The inaccessible girl, the boy who must overcome the odds, including a better-placed suitor, to get the girl.

I still remember sitting in the theater watching the opening scenes and wondering what the hell I was watching. It wasn't what I expected. I sat watching with slight interest, a beautiful love story but I was always anticipating the iceberg's appearance. By the time the ship did begin sinking the love story had worked it's magic, I cared for Rose and Jack, I cared for the passengers and crew and Somehow I found myself hoping against logic that the ship wouldn't sink. When Jack died and Rose begins ""1500 people went into the sea..."" I was crying harder than I'd ever cried and I've never cried at a film before or since. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that 1500 people died the same way jack did, and while jack may have never existed, those other 1500 did. Some people bash this film for the love story, but it helps the audience relate on an emotional level and offers an unforgettable experience if you open your heart to it. For the last 15 minutes or so I kept hoping it wouldn't end because I doubted any ending would be satisfactory. I was pleasantly surprised though for I consider the final scene in this film to be one of the most satisfying cinematic endings ever. When the lights came on I looked around and I can honestly say that I wasn't the only person sobbing - not by a long shot.

","Before anything, let me say that this was a very good movie: the special effects were incredible, and the final hour was spellbindingly powerful. And if the entire movie had been about this, had been about the Titanic itself, then I would have loved it. However, it wasn't. Instead, it supplies us with two and a half hours of a boring, predictable, badly written and badly acted romance that is no different than any other movie romance that has been seen in the past 10 years. Let's see: a pretty girl is engaged to a rich snob because of pressure from her parents, and then a young drifter (who looks suspiciously like a 25 year-old model) ""rescues"" her, and they fall in love. Gee, no cliches so far. Some of the script was awful. For example, at the beginning, Rose says, ""You think you can save me?"" and Jack responds, ""No, only you can do that."" That's fine, except then at the end, old Rose tells her granddaughter, ""there was a man named Jack who saved me, in all the ways a person can be saved."" Which is a total contradiction to what Jack told her. And the worst line of the whole movie (or any movie I've seen in recent years): the ship is going down. Right in front of their eyes thousands of innocent men, women and children are dying. So what does Rose do? She looks at Jack, smiles, and says, ""Look honey, this is where we first met!"" How dramatic! I wanted to puke. I realize that I'm nitpicking here, but my point is, if you're going to make a drama about such an important event, why give us two hours of watching Kate Winslet spit over the edge of a ship and other such things? I've met some morons say that they consider this to be the ""greatest movie ever made."" Say WHAT?! Better than Star Wars? Better than The Godfather? Better than Casablanca?

23 February 2000,TMC-4,," Worth Looking for Only for the Action Sequences and Camera Work (Some Spoilers)
","Titanic really isn't very involving in terms of its drama as it starts out. At this point, main thing that can be really worth observing is the camera work.  There are numerous long shots the movie progress, you are able to gain more of a interest with the story around the ship and its atmosphere. It that can help grab a hold on to the scenery fairly well.  As occasionally cuts back to the present day setting were the movie begins but not on a constant basis.  The drama itself at times feels to be lacking.  It tends to force several situations for dramatic impact.  Most of the bulk in Titanic belongs to the sinking of the ship.  The process of these action sequences is seemingly carefully and well constructed but along the way, it falls into various repetitious situations and dialog (e.g. the lines ""Come back"", ""Oh shi*"", and ""Never let go"").  For example, we either see children standing around and crying or crew members (who set an example of the one-dimensional supporting characters and in the process of this type of scenes usually gets punched) arguing with a group of passengers who paths are blocked.  Any other way, this period in the movie (albeit going on forever) is still interesting since it's obviously at moment of panic.",/review/rw0437184/?ref_=tt_urv

The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films.  However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see.

The incredible storytelling ability of Cameron, his audacity with special effects, and his casting prowess (who would have thought that by casting an ugly girl against a attractive guy, he would create the romance of the decade?) It's incredible hokum. What so many of the Anti-Titanic camp fail to realise is that bad acting, duff script, and glossy special effects don't necessarily mean a bad film (Star Wars as an example). The key point here is that Cameron's huge ability to target the world's biggest niche audience (the dumb middle class) is something that should be celebrated. He should be a role-model for all film makers out to make a financial success - exploitation is the key. I can sum this up in one sentence: The brains behind this picture deserve to have the $1.8billion success - the film itself doesn't",/review/rw0437008/?ref_=tt_urv

Since then I have grown from loving flashy and violent movies to more well crafted (even though sometimes still violent, like the original Star Wars of Lord of the Rings) movies. Each shot is well done. I like how anything not having to do with roses family or jacks friends actually happened. They had more that you can see in their numerous deleted scenes. All the actors were brilliant. I was surprised when I heard Kate Winslet in her British accent. The music was flawless.

27 November 1998,jmcgraw7,," how to make Titanic perfect
","This is the second time I am writing about this movie, so obviously I liked it very much, despite its many flaws. Why else would I waste my time writing about it? My earlier entry pointed out what I thought was great about Titanic, as well as what was wrong with it. I have given it more thought, and will now suggest ways I believe it could have been the perfect movie, instead of just a very good one. 1. Keep the love triangle in, but reduce the three leads' screen time (they were not *that* interesting). Instead, develop some of the other characters, especially Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) and perhaps Bruce Ismay and Tommy Ryan (Jack's Irish friend who gets shot) as well. Movie would wind up with several interesting intertwined stories (including a couple of historic ones) and more on those characters who really *were* interesting. 2. The subplot involving the diamond was silly and unecessary--you could get the old Rose in without that unbelievable and contrived situation. She could just be there because she's the oldest surviving passenger, for instance. It would still work. The movie would even work without the ""bookends"" at all, and be a lot shorter, although I understand it's a convenient way to get the footage of the real wreck in the movie, which is extremely interesting and well done. 3. The Jack and Rose characters should be played by different actors. Winslet, though a good actress, is just a little unrefined and unbelievable as a first-class passenger. Claire Danes or Gwyneth Paltrow would have been better (though I understand Danes was actually considered but declined the role). Dicaprio is too young and frail looking. Since the role is not a difficult one, *any* decent actor could have played Jack. But he should at least have a little meat on his bones! 4. Make the Jack character a bit more interesting a/o complicated. He was too ""perfect"" and therefore not very compelling. Give him a fault or two. Rose had plenty to spare! 5. Put some of the important events leading to the sinking back into the script, i.e., the Californian ignoring pleas for help, the wireless operator's role in the tragedy. Even if the movie were a *little* longer it would have made a big difference without being *too* long. (I understand that the latter was actually included in the original script but was left on the cutting room floor...why?) 6. Give the wonderful Victor Garber (Thomas Andrews) a LOT more to do. He was by far the most interesting character in the movie, seemed very deep and complex, and left me begging for more. Of all the actors, I think he was the best in the movie. 7. Don't portray *all* the first-class passengers as third-class people. This is just not the way it really happened. First of all, on the real ship, the third-class passengers were *not* locked behind--it simply took them longer to get to where the life-boats were. Also, many first-class passengers performed heroic deeds, i.e., Isador Straus and his wife (seen briefly during the band sequence as they lay on their first-class bed waiting to drown) refused to be saved, giving up their lifejackets and insisting on drowning together... People are people, and in such a tragic situation, you would see the entire range of heroism vs. cowardice in *all* the passengers, whether first, second, or third class. 8. On James Cameron's Titanic, the second class has mysteriously disappeared. Where were they? What were *their* circumstances like? (I presume they would be the middle class, as most of *us* are!) All in all, a very good movie, and perhaps I am nitpicking. But I liked it so much and have seen it so many times, I just cannot resist putting in my 2 cents.",/review/rw0436602/?ref_=tt_urv

Spoilers of Pearl Harbor! In Pearl Harbor, the girl thought Rafe (Ben Affleck) died, so she moved on to Danny (Josh Hartnett). The love story had nothing to do with the iceberg crashing. The love story was actually needed in Pearl Harbor. Also Pearl Harbor had to do with U.S. history. I know some of the parts are false history, but  some of it is true. The U.S. didn't want to go into war, but after the big bombing they had no choice. The reason the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor was because the U.S. cut their oil line. But let's get to Titanic.

I will agree with most and say that the acting is pretty bad (and the movie did not pick up any Oscars in the acting category).  James Cameron may be an arrogant jerk. And the screenplay is corny.  But the sheer awesomeness of the film is what I remembered when I saw it on the big screen in 1997.  Cameron, despite his personal faults, took us on that doomed luxury liner, literally transporting us back to 1912.  Yes, it could be argued that movies like ""A Night to Remember"" were better examinations of Titanic's final hours, and IMAX productions like Titanica had better footage of the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic.

I found  none of this in there. It is obvious from the start (from her surroundings at home) that Winslet has survived without her love, that she has lived her whole life in memory. But on a more technical side, I found the Fx lacking the immaculate touch that was needed (and, by many, seen) to create the real feeling of the disaster. Signs of bad Fx are everywhere, from the boat's surrounding water to the people falling from the deck once it has gone vertical. It all feels fake, and that is for me an instant turn-off. I also failed to see the magic between the two main actors, although I do think DiCaprio is a good actor, and Winslet is usually OK, at least for me. Only, not here. So here I am, out of curiosity having finally seen a movie everybody thought wonderful, and feeling very disappointed. Missing any suspense from the situation, and non-thrilled by the love-story, I found myself wondering what all the people saw in there that I did not.

","An extraordinary interest still exists in Cameron's film, still argument rages over just how good it is. The timing of its release was significant, the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known, a century which began with such hope and optimism, and in which the Titanic was ironically such a proud symbol.

7 September 1998,PatrynXX,9," sometimes the illusion of a good movie is all that counts
","First I'm gonna admit that for 4 months I was ranting about this movie from ocean to ocean.  Telling people that if you want to see a ship movie that is worth it, go see Das Boot.  Well April 19th I finally went to see the movie.  I went in thinking maybe 2 1/2 -3 star and came out emotionally spent.  I'm a guy and when a movie hits you that hard, I end up liking the movie so much.  What really made this movie worked was James Horner's score.  Only he could have done it.  I'm not one of those obsessed people who decided to see the movie 90 times (couldn't afford that even if I wanted to), I don't go out and buy the calendars, puzzles, shirts, diamonds related to the movie.  I do like reading about Titanic's history.  I like to take photographs, seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real.   Contrary to many people, I think Kate Winslet is the star of the show and not Leo.  He's almost a non issue except that if not because of Leo, Kate would be wandering about God only know where or dead already. I hope Kate Winslet gets some movies worth her talent.  I know Leo's Man behind the Iron Mask was less than expected. So he's not perfect either. When I watch a movie I try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie.  Want a good way to ruin a movie, that's a good way how.  It's hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it. (which is dumb anyway. you can't complain until you see it, then you have every right to.)  This is only the second time since I began watching movies that my opinions about a movie have changed so dramatically.  The other was the highly controversial movie Last Temptation of Christ. (for which for over 5 years I refused to watch it.)  Well I better quiet down , and go back to reviewing movies just for friends..... it's a hobby of mine..

","Titanic was a heart-warming true story that touches the chord of your heart and feel sympathize for those thousands of innocent people killed in one of the most horrifying accident. A young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of Titanic and falls in love with her. Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea. Reviewing Titanic would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director , James Cameron. I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I've seen the flick for the first time even though I've seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron's work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb. Overall , very emotional and heart-touching film in every sense that has re-written the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages.

The real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg.  The movie kept my attention from then on out.  Many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created.  I beg to differ.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.  When you really boil the movie down, it merely is a dressed up romance with an action/adventure tagged onto it.

","I've read a few comments about this version of Titanic and most comments seem to be written by 20 or 30 somethings who probably don't know the first thing about the real sinking of the Titanic. One comment said that he was in his thirties and that he was taken away by the fictional story intertwined with ""actual"" facts. Not true. The Titanic did not break in two as seen in this fantasy and the director simply ignored the fact that the Californian was only 10 miles away from the Titanic. So the ""actual"" facts were skewered. Secondly, at that time in history no one in steerage would be allowed to mingle with first class passengers and the young girl's background would have never allowed her to go against her mother's wishes. What seemed to have made the movie a smashing success is that Cameron did what Margret Mitchell did in Gone With The Wind, he took a modern girl and thrust her into an earlier society, and the teens - especially young impressionable girls - were carried away by the simple minded story. It would seem that most girls want to be ******* in the back seat of a car by the town ""bad"" boy. Finally, unlike the 30 something man who thought that Cameron had succeeded in the second half of the sinking, I ""never"" once thought that these people were on the Titanic, just a large ship. I have to admit that I too have seen thousands of movies and the only time I was carried away by the sinking of Titanic was the 1959 version called A Night To Remember based on an ""actual"" account of the tragedy by an eye witness,Lord Walter Lord. But, alas, any of these viewers would call that film a documentary, a dry word indeed. Heck, even the Clifton Webb, Barbara Stanwyck version seemed closer to the sinking that this over blown version.

","I can't understand why this film has come high in polls for the worst ever film. It is very well made and won 11 Oscars. It is far better than the old films about the disaster. The acting is excellent and the effects take your breath away. It wouldn't have been any more realistic if James Cameron had commissioned a shipyard to build a full-scale working replica of the ship. The film is very authentic with just one minor lapse, namely the American locomotive and rolling stock on the dockside railway seen in front of the Titanic in the view from the pub. Unlike previous films about the Titanic there is no sense of impending doom throughout the film. There is a good feeling in the first half of the film, with scenes like Jack and Fabrizio at the bow watching the dolphins while Captain Smith looks on paternalistically and the ceilidh in steerage that Jack takes Rose to. James Cameron conveys the sheer size and stability of the ship very well and the audience is drawn into the very deep security that the passengers felt. Everybody on board is very friendly apart from certain individuals in First Class. Cal Hockley is a violent overgrown spoiled brat monster child. In a lot of scenes, particularly where he shoots at Jack with a handgun, he is reminiscent of the caddish upper class villain in a silent film. Jack has been criticised for being too 1990s but the rest of the cast look and act right for the period. The crew talk authentic sounding Edwardian English. James Cameron has caught the feel of the period very well and he has said that the people in the film are in many ways not that different from us today. It's fair to say that Jack and Fabrizio are like a couple of gap year students hitch-hiking round the world. Kate Winslet, with her full curvy figure which has got her a lot of period roles and the nickname ""Corset Kate"" is spot on as Rose. The scene where Jack sketches her nude is very touching and the piano music that accompanies it is lovely. When they run past the stokers one can feel the scorching heat of the furnaces. After the ship strikes the iceberg the audience has much the same incredulity as the passengers and most of the crew that there is a possibility of the ship sinking. The sinking, as it was in real life, starts very gradually and becomes progressively more terrifying. Although there is no blood or gore shown it still is horrifying. The only blood during the sinking are the scenes where the stewards get punched. There are some really sad scenes during the sinking such as the drowned woman floating in the water and the Irish mother telling her children the old Celtic story of Ossian and Niamh. It is sad when Fabrizio is killed by the collapsing funnel and when Tommy Ryan is shot by First Officer Murdoch in the heat of the moment. Incidentally, 20th Century Fox sent one of their executives over to Scotland to apologise to the people of Dalbeattie, Murdoch's home town, about the way he was portrayed in the film. One really feels the freezing cold when Jack and Rose are in the water and I felt sad when I saw the dead baby in its mother's arms. When I saw the film in the cinema I can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking. James Cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether Rose dies or is dreaming at the end is ""You decide"". I think she died and went to Heaven and was reunited with all these people she'd known on the ship. It is a beautiful scene where she's reunited in Jack and she's all in white like a bride. Hey! I'm going against my own principles. I'm one of the most unromantic guys in the world! I'm not supposed to like these scenes!",/review/rw1577678/?ref_=tt_urv

27 April 2012,sarahmillyhannah,10," My Heart Still Goes On - More So In 3D
","I was looking through these reviews last week contemplating whether or not I should see this movie again upon its 100 year anniversary 3D release. I was looking to see if anyone had reviewed yet, more on the film's re release in its 3D glory - sadly they hadn't so I though if i want to know if its worth the price tag I will have to go. Considering myself to be interested in the titanic - not enough to call myself a Titanorack mind - I have learnt a lot about that ship, whether it be on the t.v or in books. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to don on the 3D glasses required and watch the movie. James Cameron is the king of 3D. 3D to me being pretty much a gimmick which i think only works with made for 3D films on the big screen only. Avatar is the perfect example of this. Although i didn't care for the film much the 3D is sensational. Made for 3D movies such as Avatar and Piranha etc I have enjoyed and found them effective. You can see a lot of effort has gone into the 3D for Titanic. Some of the scenes are magnificent. The lifeboats rowing away being the best 3D scene for me in the film. Was that worth the price of the ticket? I am very undecided. I love this film and have seen it numerous times and I am not sure 3D added anything extra to the film because it wasn't made for 3D it didn't have the same effect for me. I think for me it was a chance again to see the film of the big screen which I enjoyed again very much. One thing I did think about on seeing it in 3D yesterday was why on earth was Billy Zane in this film? He is more hammy than William Shatner in Star Trek and not in a good way. But where this film is concerned my heart will always go on ..so if you want to know if its worth going to see in 3D I would say if you are a massive fan or never seen it before yes, otherwise not..",/review/rw2602871/?ref_=tt_urv

","The ultimate in awful blockbusters Titanic is a long , dull and slow-paced mess. The romantic relationship between the two leads is an obvious take on films like the African Queen however it comes across as terribly cliché making the audience cringe instead of cry although a few friends of mine did cry because of how awful they thought the film was. when we finally get to the sinking of the titanic we expect a spectacle we will never forget. The effect is good but it still doesn't make the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The acting is dry, lacking any charisma and the result is like watching William Shatner for a few hours. Titanic really does not deserve the 11 academy awards it ""won""(clearly it was nominated by a group of shallow and insecure teenage girls).So far the only film that deserved that amount was Ben-Hur.",/review/rw2276277/?ref_=tt_urv

","For the people on here who commented that Titanic was the ""worst movie they've ever seen,"" apparently they haven't seen ""Showgirls"" or anything with Anna Nicole SMith. Give me a break guys. James Cameron did a phenomenal job with this movie; it truly brought the Titanic disaster back to life. Mr. Cameron did hundreds of hours (if not thousands) of research on the Titanic, including getting the poignant footage under water of the ship. A lot of facts and history with the Titanic disaster was incorporated into this movie,, giving us all the more reason to love it. Though it was over 3 hours long, I was not bored for one minute and that's very unusual for me to be able to sit through a movie this long. I was captivated by the love story and suspense Mr. Cameron created. The theme song "" My Heart Will Go On"" was perfect for the movie but it was terribly over played on the radio stations during this time. The ending was magnificent and I think everyone in the theatre cried, knowing that almost 2,000 people perished in the end. Yes, there were a couple of corny lines in the movie but no movie is perfect. I think the special effects used while the ship was sinking and the passengers were loading up in the boats, was extremely realistic and just moving. The replica ship used was also incredible. I think both Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio were fantastic in the lead, though I think Ms. Winslet was a little miscast since she looks a lot older than Leo. I have seen this movie several times and still watch it when it's on television. I do not think any other Titanic movie is superior to this one. **** 1/2 stars out of 5.",/review/rw0437860/?ref_=tt_urv

Rose is pretty in this film and her romance with Jack is very nice in this film. I think that it is the right decision that Jack dies at the end of this film because it helps to show just how tragic the sinking of the titanic was. There has been good choices of music picked to be played in this film and the acting in this movie is good. Also Rose looks, talks and behaves in a way when she is 101 years old which is similar enough to when she is 17 years old for it to be believable that she is indeed the same person and this is an interesting idea. The tension as the titanic sinks is shown well in this film and it feels like the time it takes for the titanic to sink lasts longer than it does, which is a good idea because it makes it even more dramatic that way and when terrible things happen they often feel like they last for longer than they actually do.",/review/rw5928384/?ref_=tt_urv

This is the nearly completely accurate depiction of the 1912 disaster of the ""unsinkable"" Southampton launched cruise liner Titanic. One of the biggest ships ever made Titanic is heading to New York. Jack Dawson (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) is the lucky tramp who won tickets with his friend to go onto Titanic. While touring the boat and meeting new friends he sees engaged Rose Dewitt Bukater (the gorgeous Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet). Jack and Rose form a very close friendship, which obviously becomes more. Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) is the nasty guy who is wanting to marry Rose. Unfortunately, Jack and Rose are soon threatened along with 2,200 people from the iceberg causing the sinking of the ship, what steals the show. Very teary towards the end and a beautiful story of courage and passion.

","The movie of Titanic came out in 1997. And then was an Oscar award winning. The director is James Cameron. And the actors is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose. This movie is love story. The Titanic was a ship that sank in 1992. It reorganize show film. When play ""My heart will go on"" song that will impress the movie, and then the love feeling. 3 hours long time, and then my watching is very romantic every plots, what is follow next plot. For example, Rose was flying in ships beside, that audiences were touched my heart by this shot. And then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful. Every girl want instead of Rose that is romantic plot. Second, the passengers confused around the ship after the Titan crashed iceberg, unless musicians played on ""Wedding Dance"" so quiet. The shot was satirized by this gimmick point.Discussing technology, the titanic used model ship, which have shoot really effect. The passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the titanic was sinking in the ocean. The technology is very amazing in 1997, that isn't easy play on video. So, the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing, and then the plot had a nervous environment.The movie is my favorite. Jack and Rose is excellent, and then bring me have a romantic feeling. It was complete the end from embark to accident, let's me watching Titanic event.

","3000 men worked for two years to build the most gigantic ship of all time,The Titanic,the ship which couldn't sink. 2208 bid farewell to southampton in april 1912.Little did they know that this unsinkable ship was going to sink on its maiden voyage itself. Tragedy struck,1503 people died leaving the whole world shell- shocked. Good story for a movie,right? So James Cameron decided to do it.Years of obsession,research,plotting and 200 million USD went into making this film making it the costliest and the riskiest film of all time. The result? Titanic became the highest grossing movie ever and is still the 2nd highest grosssing film of all time,only 2nd to james cameron's own avatar. What makes the film so special? Its the way it unfolds,the way it is engineered by cameron. The writing,special effects are beyond brilliant,the fictional part of the film has become iconic,everything clicks. When the movie starts,during 1st few seconds,the background music plays and right there you know that this film is going to be special,it goes on for more than 3 hours and in those 3 hours,we are told the great story of the titanic. We get to experience the splendour of the ship,know the perspective of ALL the characters and that in my opinion is where the film wins. Cameron lets us to see the things from every character's perspective,be it jack,fabrizio,rose,her mother,her fiancé,her fiance's right hand,the captain,the passengers,EVERYONE. We see how they see things and it is amazing. The tragedy is shown in perhaps the best possible way.The thrill,the tension,the fascination,the grandeur,the love,the tragedy,in these 200 minutes,we experience it all. Kudos to Cameron for making this unforgettable and immortal piece of cinema which will be watched and loved by generations to come. From a guy who has seen the whole film in excess of 130 times and is still in awe of this magical story,here's a piece of advise- watch this film now if u haven't.

24 October 1998,Hippie69,," Flashy visuals and tired cliches galore
","Universal acclaim. Top grossing film of all time. Winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. What can I say about this monster of a movie that has not already been said? How about, ""It didn't float my boat"". After months of procrastinating, I finally went for broke and sat down to view James Cameron's Titanic. I knew what to expect, after all, this is the only movie I've been hearing people talk about for the past six months. Here is my impression of this film. It's a mixture of a Jane Austen novel, a Disney animated feature, and The Poseidon Adventure rolled up into one nice $200 million package. What do I mean by a Disney movie? Well, as I was sitting there watching Leo DiCaprio savor Kate Winslet's delicate touch, I thought to myself, ""Where have I seen this before?"". The answer: The plot is almost identical to that in Disney's Aladdin. You know the one: A beautiful rich girl is bored with her aristocratic lifestyle and longs to have some fun. She is supposed to marry a wealthy fellow, which her parents are pushing her to do. Then she meets a poor fellow, and grows to love him. The poor lad shows her a good time like her rich lifestyle never could. But what about her rich fiancee? What's a girl to do? Sounds like Aladdin doesn't it? And George of the Jungle. And countless sitcom episodes. Even Wayne's World made fun of it. And that is one of the twelve or so original movie plots which have been used over and over through the years. And once again, James Cameron recycles it, but this time he puts the story on a really big boat, and gives it a tragic ending to try to squeeze every last tear out of the audience. I've never really been impressed with Cameron's writing, and after seeing Titanic, I'm still not. I can't say much for the acting either. Billy Zane is just too ""Aren't I evil?!"" to be taken seriously. However, the good thing about this film is the technical expertise of James Cameron. The ship-sinking portion of the film is fabulous, from a technical perspective. Give Jim Cameron a camera and a few hundred million dollars and he can cook up a really great looking product. Just be sure to get someone else to write the script. I still insist that Contact, Boogie Nights and The Apostle are the best films of 1997. Titanic does not even come close.

But I say this film is and always was terrible. The most horrid was of 194 minutes in my entire life. The story of the Titanic, first off, is not very interesting to watch for three odd hours. And the artificial love story does not help down this horse pill of a movie. The music is the only thing that I enjoyed, but even that wore out its welcome near the last hour of the film. Cameron should've sunk this film before it came out and robbed people of 1.8 billion hard-earned dollars. I'm sorry to myself for seeing this film because everyone else was, and I'm sorry to everyone else who saw this embracement for this reason.

","I had the misfortune to be taken to see this film and spent an agonising three hours with the will to live seeping away from me all the time, so what's wrong with it? DeCaprio, from a purely unbiased mans view I can see the appeal to the more uncritical female section of the audience, however he was totally acted off the screen by the glorious Kate Winslet. This is not the first time consistently he is given parts that most actors would kill for only to find himself completely upstaged by much better actors, remember Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Daniel Day Lewis in that abomination Gangs of New York. I rest my case. The soundtrack by Celine Dion left me with the urge to scream with tedium, good voice shame about the material! The film is over long and I can not see the necessity for the length the plot certainly didn't present any challenges or surprises. The Titanic disaster in reality was about people and peoples responses differed to the in relation to it, it was not only the rich who were cowardly and oppressive in reality there was a lot of bravery shown as well, in other words HUMANITY at its best and worst. I found the Hollywood gross oversimplification at best insulting at worst the stereotype portrayed about the Irish deeply insulting and approaching racist. In summation I would say that the experience was something similar to visiting a slightly dementing older relative and being left alone in their company for a day. The relationship between DiCaprio and The glorious Winslet (OK I'm Biased) could not carry the entire film especially given its length. I ended up praying for the iceberg and virtually cheering when DiCaprio sank without a trace.

A record that was kept for twelve years, until Cameron's next film, 'Avatar' outsold Titanic's ticket sales in 2009.

I'm sure it's the mass hysteria over Leo Dicrappio's cute little girly face that charmed female teen audiences, or Kate Winslet's breast shots. First off, I did not care for any character on this boat. None. Zilch. So, therefore, I was relieved when the ship sank and the heartless, snobs drowned. Note to movie makers: If you're going to make a film like this, give the characters some depth, and life, instead of flashing their cute smiles and snobby attitudes, and then maybe you'll have a halfway decent movie. Secondly, why was Boogie Nights shunned, when it was a far superior film than this. And why wasn't Russell Crowe nominated for Best Actor, and why oh why did this win so many Oscars? I'm crying now. This is a travesty on movie goers everywhere. They expect someone like me, who thinks he has some sort of brain to swallow this garbage? It makes me look like a fool to watch it. It also has come to my attention that since this is the biggest film of all time (puh-lease), that everyone is trying to milk it for every penny. Titanic t-shirts, jewelry, puzzles, novelty items, you name it, it's being done. I could go on and on about this, but I won't. So to sum it all up, I hate this movie. I hate it. I hate everything about it. I detest it. I despise every single thing about it.  I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate this movie! I hate it so much that whenever I see a commercial for it, I am tempted to throw my remote control at the television and smash it. Yes, I hate this movie. I hate it. I hate it.

","Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song ""My Heart Will Go On"" was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place).

","I am simply amazed that such a popular, beloved, critically and audience acclaimed film favorite as ""Titanic"" could sink so unseemly in the minds of so many who shelled out heavy sums of money and lauded it heavily at the time of its tremendous popularity. While ""Titanic"" is hardly as fresh, riveting, and entertaining as it was when I first viewed it several years ago, it still certainly retains a special distinction in the realm of cinema, at least in my assessment. Perhaps the screenplay is overly blase, full of clichés, and historical blunders, and the spectacle and sheer horror of seeing hundreds plummet to the bottom of the Atlantic is not as harrowing as it seemed in theaters, yet ""Titanic"" is still a fine, worthy, and sensational cinematic triumph. ""Titanic""'s technical aspects: its impeccable mix of sound and visual effects, dramatic and potent musical score (detract the obsolete ""My Heart Will Go On""), ingenious costume design, absorbing cinematography, and of course the gorgeous, stupendous design of the ship, still stand well above many efforts in cinematic history today, and are plenty appreciated and admired. The romance between Rose and Jack is perhaps the most cliché and nauseating aspect of the film, which, despite the film's perception as being ""extremely overrated"" might be ""Titanic""'s primary detractor, and that would be fully understandable- if these same critics weren't the ones who rushed to the cinemas to embrace the romance in the film! Overall, ""Titanic"" is a leviathon of a film: boasting popularity and critical acclaim and some really brilliant cinematic aspects, where it somewhat lacks in the script and the romance. I have probably viewed ""Titanic"" over 100 times, and though its value and enticement has been compromised through numerous viewings, it still retains a laudable, important distinction as providing both rock-solid entertainment and brilliant cinematic quality, and these features are too complimentary for such a film as ""Titanic"" to sink through history. ***1/2 out of ****",/review/rw0950231/?ref_=tt_urv

Street urchin is properly glorified and the betrothed vilified), and the acting was subpar (the only character I actually liked was the ship's designer). That leaves this movie with what every other James Cameron flick has: special effects. Unfortunately, they're not great enough to redeem the three hours plus this movie takes to endure.  I was looking at my watch more than the screen when I first saw it, and I'd point anyone who wants to see this movie to films that deserved an Oscar but didn't receive one due to the Academy's buying the hype.",/review/rw0436898/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie may be the cheesiest film on the planet but I loved it!!! I don't know if I can express in words how great this movie is. All I can really say is this is a film that you will want to share with your grandchildren. I will admit there was a corny line or two especially on Leo Dicaprio's character and in my opinion I honestly thought Kate Winslet out shined Dicaprio even though Dicaprio did have his share of great moments in the movie. I really loved Jack Dawson but I just felt that his character was almost too one dimensional. When I first saw the movie I thought it would be a load of crap... boy was I wrong I was so entranced into the love story that I totally forgot that this was TITANIC so when the iceberg showed up I found myself sort of praying against all logic that somehow titanic would miss the iceberg, I even remember leaning to one side of my seat thinking if I did this the ship would miss lol. and of course when tragedy struck and the ship was sinking I was really caring for Jack,Rose and all the other passengers and even then I kept thinking maybe it will stop sinking and these poor people wont have to die. Throughout the rest of the film I was in complete utter shock I don't even think I blinked. even when Jack died I was in disbelief and in my head I was screaming along with rose for jack to wake up. The only time I cried in the film was at the very end of the movie when you see the titanic morphing into a new and pristine state and you see all the passengers inside greeting rose as she comes in then Jack extends his hand to her and they share a passionate kiss and everyones clapping, I was uncontrollable and the tears just kept coming.

","I held off on viewing Titanic until it was let out on tape. I had heard horror stories from friends and colleagues. They spoke of oceans of tearfilled faces and groups of 12 year old girls singing along with that god-awful Celine Dion song. So I dodged the theaters until a friend bought the tape. Out of morbid curiosity to see this ""epic"" film, I borrowed the tape, and sat down to watch it with her. My lord, it was the LONGEST freakin' piece of schlock I have ever seen. As my friend began to sob after the death of Leonardo, I got about as emotional as I do when I watch those AT&T long-distance commercials. You know, the ones where a little boy in L.A. talks to his daddy who is on a business trip in New York. And the boy always tells his father, ""I love you, daddy."", then the music cues to pictures of the teary-eyed father. Well, I saw a parallel between the commerical and movie Titanic. Both are contrived, blatantly staged, and chocked full of cardboard characters. The film was a filthy attempt to contort and force the emotions of the lowest common denominator. An striking example of this film's attempt to grab people and literally wrench the tears out of them come with the scene where the frozen, dead mother cradles her frozen child in her arms. Had this scene been in any fillm where the emotions were not completely artificial, I would have cried. But the fact is that this film was devoid of any real, heart-felt emotion. So when I saw this scene, I felt nauseous and grew full of spite. I now loathe Cameron for his utterly plastic,  inhumane protrayal of the Titanic disaster. Yet it appears he tapped a class of people bountiful enough to garner Titanic in excess of 600 million dollars in the states alone. I never knew America was so replete with people of such bad taste, people who would not only like, but view repeatedly this sad excuse for cinema. I weeped after seeing Titanic, but not do to its shoddy screenplay or horrifically unrealistic acting and emotions. I weeped for America, and the death of American filmmaking. I weeped knowing that such a film could garner accolades and billions of dollars, and that this bounty would push studios to make bigger films with smaller characters, crappy scripts and pretty faces devoid of ability that would pack seats no matter the quality of the film. (Here comes the TITANIC melodrama.) I could see a future where Coppola, Kubrick, and Malick stood on the gallows, pleading to the masses, now anesthetised and made prostrate by Springer and the numerous Titanic sequels. The directors voiced there thoughts on the death of intellect in America, then the masses let them hang as they chanted ""Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!""",/review/rw0436613/?ref_=tt_urv

",James Cameron's masterpiece a movie that has Almost everything in it love romance Heroism and sacrifice and unbridled Evil. And the best part most of it is true. Cameron's Titanic is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers Rose Dewitt and Jack Dawson. Winslet and Decaprio deliver career making performances here. I had been impressed with Decaprio from What's eating Gilbert Grape and discovered this young man can act He stole a movie from Johnny Depp not a easy thing to do. But anyways. Rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by Billy Zane. Rose's Mother was once married to a man who was once Rich but spent all the money and Died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt. So Rose must marry a detestable man for his money. In fact once they reach America they will be married. Jack Dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of Titanic. Jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life. Things happen when he rescues Rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for Jack in their world he is beneath them. Jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but Rich in other ways They are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing. However Rose's Mother and her groom to be have discovered that Rose has fallen for Jack and all their planning in now in danger. Then comes the unthinkable the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to flood. The Captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable Titanic sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after. Jack and Rose struggle to survive the death of Titanic and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean. There is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on Titanic looking for treasure and getting involved with old Rose who tells the story. But the Real story here is Cameron's dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the Titanic and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off Big. I took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and I groaned thru the romance and I laughed at the end when Dicaprio's Heroic Jack Dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings. However 13 years later I saw the film on TV again and watched it from the beginning and I Caught all of it. And I understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the Cult of Decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful.

The first part of the movie was straight-forward and the acting was decent, and yes, I'm not afraid to admit it, but Leonardo Dicaprio did a good job. However, I'm a big fan of action/thriller movies, and the second half of Titanic could have been much better. For one, there were too many scenes of unimportant people falling this way and that and dying. If they focused more on the main characters, that would cut off some extra running time. Also, I'm not too sure that a disaster thriller and a romance story can mix into an overall product. You know the boat is gonna sink, so why throw in a whole different second storyline? This at times makes a movie look overstuffed. Overall, this movie has its ups and downs. I don't highly reccomend it, but all I can say is that it'll amaze some people and stupify other people.

At least five of my friends would not see it because Leonardo diCaprio is a teen idol, and they feel above associating with that kind of thing. The dialogue is pitched at a very general level - the last thing you'd call it is poetic. I think part of what rubbed so many critics the wrong way, is that this is a completely new approach to the Victorian romance. (I know, 1912 isn't precisely Victorian, but it's close, and as the 'Edwardian romance' isn't really a genre, that's what people will be comparing this with.) Room With A View this ain't.

Its tragic sinking will always be remembered, for the ship went down on the first voyage with heavy losses. The director of the film is James Cameron. The main parts in the film are played by young actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. To my mind their acting is superb. The camerawork is fantastic, too. I've heard that they made a full-size model of the ""Titanic"" for this film. It's a very spectacular film. It is also a moving love-story. I advise all my friends to see ""Titanic"".

","Okay, everyone knows what happens in ""Titanic"", so I'll discuss a few other points. While the movie was in the theaters, one of my friends went to see it 13 times, just so that he could find goofs; the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door, turns his head, and you see that it's the wrong color. When I took a sailing class in summer, 2005, the teacher explained why specifically the Titanic sank: it was traveling way too fast for something that size (so they couldn't turn in time), and the metal on the ship's sides was rather shoddy; that is to say, they endangered everyone's lives so as to save money for themselves (well, that's one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety). And I have a question: considering how many people died on the Titanic, was it appropriate to use this event to further Leonardo DiCaprio's career? As for that story that I wrote, it portrayed Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck (from ""In & Out"") believing themselves to resemble Leo and Kate; Al Pacino (from ""Donnie Brasco) realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes; Jim Carrey (from ""Liar Liar"") admitting: ""I can't lie: I wasn't watching for icebergs while I was steering!""; Kim Basinger (from ""LA Confidential"") wondering whether or not she would look like Veronica Lake at the bottom of the ocean; and Jack Nicholson (from ""As Good as It Gets"") still inside his cabin and saying ""Don't knock on my door!

As a history movie, Titanic is a top-20 film, but as a love story it falls flat for me. Call me heartless, but this movie did not affect me.

","James Camerons, Titanic is a film that everyone knows about and one that every movie fan will have to watch at some point and it's worth such praise as I found this to be a fantastic film with one of the best romances ever put to screen. By far the most admirable thing about this movie is the fact that it never drags despite being over three hours long that because they use every scene to fullest to either increase the chemistry between Jack and Rose or to get attached to the characters you know are doomed. The title ship looks incredible in this movie everything from the lower cabins to the luxurious cigar rooms look nothing less than life like. This first and foremost is a love story and that works for this movie it helps to give the eventual tragedy more weight to it and there's not a single second where you don't believe either of these to people aren't in love. You just feel like they belong with each other and need each other and it takes two exceptional performances to capture that. Leonardo DiCaprio is just perfect casting in this films he's incredibly likable and entertaining and hate to see him trampled over by the first class passengers. Kate Winslet though gave the best performance in this film you feel that despite the fact that she has infinite riches she feels completely alone and she portrays that perfectly and her final scenes with Jack are absolutely heartbreaking to watch. The final hour of Titanic is centred around the sinking of the ship and never have Tension and Desperation been captured quite like this every single scene brings a new obstacle or challenge and just gradually seeing the water rise adds to the tension all the more. There's a lot of scenes in this film where characters are only looking out for themselves and are leaving others behind to die but you don't hate them for it (except Cal) you understand their desperation and will to survive and the viewer has to face the fact that they would likely to things very similar in the same situation. This is however not a perfect movie it does have some flaws, for one a lot of the side characters, specifically the first class passengers, just have nothing to them their just their to be hate able and to give more obstacles for Jack and Rose to cross and more could have been done with them. I also think that their was no need to focus so much on the present day storyline it takes up to much time toward the beginning and should have kept all these scenes until the ending of the film and could've still had the same impact.

","As a lifelong holder of minority opinions, much of my time is spent baffled in wonderment as to how a seemly intelligent person could've paid good money to go see ""The English Patient"" twice during its original run. Or says ""Love Story"" is the greatest romantic movie ever made. Or who prefers the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" to the remake. And one of the biggest thorns in my side about movies is this piece of garbage which trivializes the catastrophe that was the sinking of the Titanic by making it a turbulent backdrop for a badly-derived Romeo and Juliet ripoff. Pretty boy Pauper sees Rich kid Rosie (or whatever her name was) and goes, ""Dude, I have GOT to tap dat!"" With a little help from Kathy Bates, he convinces her to slum it with him in the steam room in perhaps the most gratuitous sex scene that made lonely women go ""Ohhhh..."" in years. Then the boat sinks. Several thousand people die, but the REAL victim (says Cameron) is the girl because she must live on with the memory of that blond piece of ass she shagged on the boat. I think what pisses me off most about this movie (besides the fact that if the girl had scooted over on that bit of wood a little bit, she could've shared it with the man she supposedly loved. Or they could've taken turns in the water, but God forbid she get her dress wet) is the fact that the story really had nothing to do with the boat. They could've made up a fictional boat crash and it not only would've been more appropriate, but it would've made more sense. And that Celine Dion song? Maybe the worst I've heard since Art Garfunkel's ""Bright Eyes.""

The movie doesnt know whether it wants to be a teenie-bopper chick flick or an action movie, and the bizarre transition from one to another is even worse. I have watched many movies that top the 3 hour mark that I have thoroughly enjoyed (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Terminator 2) but these movies use the length to benefit the story, while Titanic simply uses it as an excuse for more explosions, more soggy dialog and an excuse for Winslet to get naked. I am not bias to the love story genre, but this just takes it to a new level of badness. How it won best picture is beyond me. 4/10 stars (I admit I have seen worse)",/review/rw0436442/?ref_=tt_urv

","Romance isn't really my thing tbh, so it wasn't as enjoyable for me, but I love both of Jack and Rose's characters, and how they were fit for each other. The ending was sad, not just for the couple, but for all the people who were separated from each other or died during the tragedy of the Titanic. This film portrayed it well. I hated Rose's mom and fiancé so much. I'm glad she didn't return to them and pursued her dreams and experience the life she wanted to live in the end. My favorite part was the process of the sinking of the Titanic, it was really interesting and educational, but also suspenseful and sad. Tbh, the Titanic should've had many test runs by the captain and crew before setting off, so it could avoid such tragedies. Then there could be a happy ending for everyone, Rose could still run away, but then the movie would lose purpose, so yea. I love all the actors and acting, especially Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio. This movie was really good, and will be forever, no matter how many times you watch it.

What he didn't need to do, however, was make Jack die since he was a main character.    If I produced this movie, I would have made Cal freeze to death instead and Jack would marry Rose.  The present time would have both Jack and Rose as an elderly couple talking about what had happened.  Another thing that bothers me is how these third class passengers were treated.  The crewmen wouldn't allow them to go up to the deck until all the first and second class people were loaded onto the lifeboats.   After breaking down the door, the third class passengers fled to the deck.  Some of them, however, gave up and stayed down in the steerage.  The scene where the Irish mother is telling her children a story to put them to sleep is very sad.  I really hated Rose's mother Ruth.  She was very nasty and shallow.  The ship is sinking, many people are dying, and all she cares about is that the lifeboats are seated according to class?  What a b****!

How about his moment of silence for those who perished on the Titanic? Perhaps Cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was making millions dramatizing their tragedy. Perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies. I don't know. What I do know is that it was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in Academy history. But Cameron doesn't stop there; he simply cannot leave good-enough alone, so he continues to babble on incessantly as his head continues to expand.

There's no doubt the star of this film was the special effects. Without that, it's just an average movie.  The writing was corny, and the acting had a lot to be desired. First and foremost, the woefully miscasting of Leo DiCaprio as the hero. His looks are more like a newspaper boy than world-traveling artist. How am I am supposed to accept DiCaprio as a lover, when he looks as though he has yet to have his first date. Billy Zane's acting was not much better. His character was cartoonish. I half-expected Zane to twirl his mustache, if he had one, saying ""Curses, foiled again"". Kate Winslet seemed to be the only main star that acted well and had decent lines.

Sadly it stayed in my city for only 2 weeks and I could see it only today-- I had to go to a city 2 hours away from mine to catch this. In the first scenes I could see some cheesy lines and overacting-- mainly from DiCrapio and Paxton. After the first hour, the cheesy lines became less aggressive and I could stop remembering all the time that it is just a movie. The story is so well done that you feel inside the ship. They made a 3 hours plot so interesting and entertaining that you feel the movie just ended too fast. The relationship between the main couple-- although repeating the same old formula from Romeo and Juliet-- seems so realistic that we get jealous and want to have the same feeling they have. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to find someone you truly like in real life. One remarkable quote is when Jack says ""Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me""; you see, Jack was suffering with cold and about to die, but he still thought that dying would be worth it after the strong love they had-- which is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional lines in cinema history. Special effects are also quite good, some scenes are IMPOSSIBLE to explain how they've been built-- 3D or not. The story is all completely sad and painful to imagine, and you'll probably be very sad after seeing the whole picture, but will make you cherish your life even more.

Lead acting performances are uniformly well done, though the dialogue they have to work with is disappointing. The film is hampered by an unimaginative screenplay, with trite dialogue and poor situations. But the film starts of well enough. The first one half or two hours are enthralling and even breezy, doing well to hide the films poor writing, and are a joy to watch. After this however, the tender love story which has played out is replaced with frantic, frenzy action for the next hour or so. This is the section after the ship strikes the iceberg, as the film attempts to, like a typical Hollywood film, milk every single situation and obstacle they can. This, rather than being suspenseful, just felt boring, languid, and contrived. Thankfully, the film reverts to tenderness in the last 20 minutes, with jack and rose on a piece of wood and the famous ending. The problematic bits of the film are hence those where Jack and rose are engaged in action rather than romance. Hence, I think the movie is overlong, and should've been trimmed down at the parts mentioned.

7 October 2014,cornellthorn,10," A Fantastic Movie
","I never thought that a ship wreck would be able to produce such an amazing, and romantic movie. James Cameron did an amazing job at synchronizing a horrific event in history with the everlasting love between Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Titanic is a movie that keeps you on your toes whether it's between the two love interests or between the tragic events that is happening to the ship, and the people while the boat plunges into the water. To me Titanic is a five out of five movie because of the amazing actors/actresses, the story line, the message it relays at the end, and all the different characters that made this movie so diverse. While watching Titanic you have no choice but to fall in love with the characters which made me want to watch the movie even more. The actors/actresses were amazing when portraying the characters they were supposed to be. The way they fell into character so easily was elegant. The director made the characters so diverse, which made it more interesting to see how different classes of people were treated back in 1979. The people that were chosen to portray the characters actually looked as if they were born for that particular role. You could feel the sincere emotions the actors were giving off while in character which made the audience open up to the movie. The movie was so interesting that the audience could watch the movie over and over again and it will never get tiresome. A contributing factor to success of Titanic was how the movie told the background of some of the characters. They were able to tell the story behind most of the cast members like the husband, mother, newlywed couple, and the young unfortunate families. Some of the characters in the movie might have not been intended to be significant, but ended up being very important to the impact the movie had on the audience's emotions. For example while the boat is sinking there is a mother who is tucking her kids away into their beds. She felt like that was the only choice she had, because she knows that with their social status they would have no chance of survival. All she wanted to do was comfort her kids and make sure they were at ease right before they all perish. Just that scene alone played an important role in the audience reaction and emotions. The movie also relayed a very unique personal message that was very meaningful. The Director showed that love can conquer anything, and can last forever even throughout death. In the beginning of Titanic we noticed that the very first time Jack saw Rose he instantly fell in love. Through the entire movie the audience see how their connection grows into this deep love that neither one of them have ever experienced. Rose was engaged to one of the wealthiest men on the boat, and she gave it all away because of the connection her and jack shared. Even when the ship was sinking Jack and Rose was so passionately in love they literally did anything for each other. For example, Rose went into the bottom of the boat, which was filled with water, to rescue jack, who was handcuff to a pipe and left to drown. Also, Rose jumped off one of the only life boats in order to stay with jack cause she knew that she couldn't go on without him, or how Jack let rose lay on floating wood in order for her to stay out the freezing water and stay alive. All of those contributing factors made the movie great. I fell in love with Titanic and will recommend the movie to anyone. After watching this movie it became a part of history and any and every one would love watching it. When watching the movie you fall in love with the message that the movie gives you. The characters that are being portrayed make you fall in love with the movie as well. This movie makes you want to watch over and over and anyone would love it.",/review/rw3100768/?ref_=tt_urv

","OK, I do have something other to say too. First I want to say, I really liked this movie. Great special effects, beautiful succesful young hollywood stars, a romantic love story and a catastrophe 80 years ago. What else do you need from a movie? But then I started thinking more: First thing that started annoying me was well, the entire idea. Who gives James Cameron the right to romanticize a terrible accident that took the life of a thousand people? Sure, the movie shows us how cruel the reality is. But the movie seems to tell us that Titanic and it's sinking are nothing compared to the sad and once-in-a-lifetime-lovestory. Then the second thing that annoyed me was the main plot: A rich girl and a poor boy and rich girl's parent(s) try to keep them apart? C'MON, like we haven't seen that before!!! The whole lovestory was just a big cliche´ with of course required tears in the end. The best thing was FANTASTIC special effects. The sinking looks so real that it almost feels you were there yourself. BUT not even the greatest cover hide the empty inside.

","Boy do i hate this movie.  I'm so happy this isn't in the imdb's top 250. I'm a little angry it isn't in the bottom 250, it should be. This movie is more predictable than the alphabet.  For those people who haven't seen it, God Bless You.  Please don't see it.  If you see it, it will be a greater tragedy than the sinking of the Titanic.  Let me give you an example of how long and boring it is.  If you stare at a clock tick down for 24 hours it will fell shorter than watching this movie.  The lines are such a joke, let me express myself on a couple.  ""I'm flying"" - Kate Winslet.  If i was beside her at that moment, i would pick her up and throw her overboard and my line would be ""no your not.""  Than the movie would end and it would save everybody sitting in the audience a lot of time.  Another garbage line was ""you jump, i jump"" - Kate Winslet.  I could have done alot with that moment, more than James Cameron that's for sure.  I would have made them both jump off the boat and get eaten by Jaws (wow what an ending!).  That would also save some time.  The soundtrack was one of the worst i ever had.  It is a shame the great James Horner didn't win an oscar for Braveheart but won one for this movie.  Celine Dion still has the most annoying song i will ever hear the rest of my life.  Every time i saw her video i wanted to drop kick my television set, in hopes i might actually hit her, and shut her up.  I am very happy this film won no acting awards, that is the only justice the Academy Awards handed out that year.  I was so happy when the stupid row boat sank.

Seldom does the excessive expenditure lead to a better script, better acting, better direction or better photography, and these are what govern the quality of the final product. Titanic won an incredible number of Oscars, which are supposed to be completely independent awards (11 in all I believe). At the time I cynically took the view that the need for these Oscars as a bait for attracting large audiences had led to extensive funding of media promotions designed to ensure that this particular film was in the mind of all the judges when the selections were actually being made. I also remember feeling very upset that several superb performances in lesser low budget films made during the same year appeared to be being squeezed out by all this hoop-la.

But ""Apollo 13"", despite its faults, showed that a story of this sort (albeit one with a happier ending) can still succeed through a low-key focus on the human condition in a state of adversity.  For ""Titanic"", however, writer-director James Cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance, in which Kate Winslet's feisty, intelligent (and way too modern) heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of Leonardo diCaprio.  Boy-man diCaprio appears hopelessly miscast, playing a ""man of the world"" in the fashion of the lead in a high school rom-com.  In fact, his role is a pretty straight reprise of his Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's brilliant Shakespeare adaptation - but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role, in Titanic he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunity.",/review/rw0437711/?ref_=tt_urv

They absolutely convinced me they were in love. Once the ship strikes the iceberg, the scenes of terror and mayhem that follow are mesmerizing to watch. Titanic remains an awesome spectacle with some tender scenes and a heart-breaking romance.",/review/rw2013299/?ref_=tt_urv

The main characters are well developed,personally I would like a bit more sub plot,but because Rose and Jack become real people it makes the story so much more moving.The last hour is simply breathtaking and one asks the question of one self how would I behave in that situation.So watch this film in April every year and thank God you weren't there. 8/10",/review/rw0436491/?ref_=tt_urv

Paramount has done an outstanding job of bringing the pictorial and auditory splendor of this film to its latest video incarnation. Watching this story unfold after about a year reminds one of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. Cameron has used many of the tried and true movie conventions to great effect.  Slow motion enhances the lovers' flight through the engine rooms, using the glow of the furnaces to foreshadow the romantic scene to come and the ensuing tragic events.  Instead of constantly bombarding the viewer with a blaring soundtrack, in the sequence just before the ship finally sinks, the director uses the spare violins playing  `Near My God to Thee' as the Captain, the architect and other characters near their approaching doom. The sound design also includes some extremely effective use of surround sound as Rose (Kate Winslet) searches the bowels of the ship for Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).

The scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence. I believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of Oscars earned.

The sinking of Titanic was a disaster and Cameron never gave me the impression that it was a disaster. I never saw real emotions, it all came down on overacting and commercial emotions. I guess for someone who doesn't see as many movies as I do, Titanic will be a great movie. The movie never worked up to its expections and it never showed why it had cost so much money.

30 June 2001,teejayniles2345,9," ""Inspired"" by historical events but not constrained
","This blockbuster is a milestone in film making and a career peak for Director/Producer James Cameron.  When this film bowled over the competition (except in acting and writing categories) at the Academy Awards,  it could be the occasion of a gleeful self-coronation (Mr. Cameron as ""King of the World"").  It had set box office records and was probably also record-breaking for multiple ticket purchases by teen fans of such a long epic.  Like its ""older sister"" GONE WITH THE WIND, this Best Picture Oscar-winner exists in a self-enclosed quasi-historical environment where the beautiful survive and thrive despite morally despicable transgressions. It claims to be ""inspired"" by actual events around the sinking and recent re-discovery at ocean's bottom. Those who love TITANIC feel that the mismatched couple outdo ""Romeo & Juliet"" as a most appealing ""eternal"" couple.  Teen fans of Leonardo DiCaprio would gladly throw caution to the wind as did the lead actress who poses nude quite immodestly.  As an unimpressed but still positive-minded fan of this movie overall, however, I have loads of questions to ask those who defend this as ""one of the all-time best movies"" (A.F.I. put it in the category of MOST THRILLING in its 2001 list recently).  For example, shouldn't a more specific disclaimer be attached to the closing credit acknowledgments about the ship's crew and captain who are ""transformed"" unnecessarily and untruthfully into brutish villains? Since real names of actual dead are attached to some ""inspired"" crew and passengers, attentive audience members assume that those historical people who deserve blame (like Bruce Ismay) are those who did kill and threaten others and otherwise act like the most wicked people ever.  Too many names can be exonerated and should be since this script took liberties with depicting the desperate, final actions of the crew.  As a second example, why doesn't Molly Brown get her lifeboat over to help those floating in life-jackets (in regular history, this IS (!) part of her claim to fame)?  Furthermore, what happened to Fabrizio in the film's middle?  How is it that the 100+ year-old is unsupervised at film's end?  Does the special effects wizardry paper over and rationalize the simplistic ""chase"" elements of the film's quite long middle?  I felt a bit confused whether the drowned victims were mostly ""caged in"" by the class-bigots among the fictional crew ""stewards"" or if they were just too slow in figuring out a strategy like the romantic couple had as the Titanic goes down for the third time.  Any help on these issues, Mr. Cameron and defenders of his script?  I didn't expect to know if time ""stood still"" when the ship takes on water but the film takes the ""worst spin"" on how the lifeboats get loaded and away in time to save only 1/3 of those aboard.  Were these numbers strictly correct? The facts could have been a little better adhered to, in my opinion. Again, this is an amazing entertainment product and a Hollywood legend's masterpiece.",/review/rw0436324/?ref_=tt_urv

So, the ending ruined the entire movie for me...it just did. James Cameron must enjoy watching people leave a movie feeling betrayed and deceived by Rose. True love by Rose...not in my eyes. Plus, Jack would never have met Rose. The first and second class passenger decks were had gate locks from the third class passenger decks due to immigration and health laws. Total non-fiction.

","Titanic is one of the best movies of the decade. Interestingly, it was the official script book that got me to notice this film ... since I took pains to IGNORE Titanic when it first came out. I thought the hype was a bit too much, and I really hated Celine Dion's performance on an otherwise excellent song. Now that I have seen the film, I can't see what many people are complaining about. The b-story of Jack and Rose's romance is touching and never dull, the historical facts are generally accurate, except for a few minor errors. But a lot of people forget this film is told from the point of view of a 101-year-old woman! I rarely find myself choking up watching a film, but this show did it to me -- the only other movie ever to make me cry is the excellent Hawks (1989). Repeated viewings of Titanic only make the experience better, because you get to see different things each time. By the way, anyone staying away from Titanic because of Celine Dion will be happy to note her song doesn't appear until the closing credits ...  the rest of the time James Horner's exquisite work carries the film.",/review/rw0437101/?ref_=tt_urv

The movie is phenomenal. There's a group of a research ship in 1996 or 1997 exploring the wreck of the Titanic and one who is obsessed with finding a diamond that was worn by someone on the ship. They recover a safe that they think it might be in. It isn't in there but there is a picture of a girl wearing a necklace with the diamond and this is shown on the news. The girl in the picture, named Rose, sees it, recognizes herself, and calls them and tells them the girl in the picture is her. They have her come there and she tells a story of being on the Titanic and the movie switches to the day the Titanic left on the trip where it sunk. It goes back and forth from 1912 to 1996 or 1997. The 1912 part focuses on Rose and a boy named Jack who, out of luck in a game, was able to get a ticket to the Titanic.

Since the ending is already known without having to view it even once,  I am curious to know what drew so many people to see it numerous times.  The story-line was sometimes no better than one of those nickel romance books and perhaps that was what drew the audience it did?  There was nothing spectacular about the acting; on the contrary, I found all of the performances, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, quite uninspired and boring.

","When I heard ""Titanic"" and I heard ""DiCaprio"" I thought ""Romeo and Juliet 2"". How wrong I was! James Cameron takes his amazing film making and, with maybe a weaker screenplay than in all his other movies, he makes this impressive and unforgettable exercise of construction, and I mean building the ship and building a rising climax that will go with you after watch the movie. The story jumps from the predictable stuff (you know the ship sinks, that never changes) to the heart and soul of characters that have no idea of their future, for good or bad. All starts with a simple drawing, and from that simplicity we move to jaw-dropping chases in the guts of the ship, hear-breaking love moments and many extras falling. The rhythm is a little bit slow in the first two acts, but from the moment the iceberg and the ice enter in scene, wow, here is Mr Aliens again. Kate Winslet moves from classic first class lady to Lt Ripley's daughter, the ship of dreams turns into the bath of nightmares, the history accuracy fights against Cameron's Machiavellian film making, and at the end, you just cry in joy, sadness and suffering. The best sequence of all this? The ship splitting is awesome, but Nearer my God to thee is a heart-touching, tear-jerking, whimper moment, with that Irish mother cuddling her children before die, the Captain facing his destiny and the band playing to the very end.

21 May 2020,Pjtaylor-96-138044,6," A sinking feeling.
","'Titanic (1997)' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron's seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director's motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it's apparently content with 'filling in the gaps' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn't mean it's automatically good, though. It's undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history 'against all odds' romance (and that's not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it's effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the 'clash of the classes' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn't get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn't exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don't have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn't beautiful; it's devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It's the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst 'face replacement' I've ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn't as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It's long and uneven, but it's probably worth a go if you're a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10",/review/rw5759199/?ref_=tt_urv

","Now firstly, I was impressed at the effort put into this film... HOWEVER, after seeing it, I have come to this conclusion: This would be a great movie were it not for the lack of originality, what you see here is an ancient plot line marketed on the blood of people who died in this tragedy, if you want to see a similar film, get out Romeo and Juliet (another DiCaprio film) which contains exactly the same appalling rigid acting from young Leonardo and practically the same plot line! Boy meets girl, girl already engaged or to be engaged with a fatal divide, in R+J it's the family divide (Montigues and Capulets), in titanic it is the barrier between the rich and the poor, the only reason this desecration of Shakespeares work (Romeo and Juliet + Boat) sold is because it had special effects involving the sinking of the liner 'The Titanic', THAT was it's USP, what else is there? The story? Already covered that. The acting? Hell no. A girl in one of my classes at college was praising the writer on such an imaginative story: "" How did he come up with the idea of creating this story of a large ship sinking AND adding love."" Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't base this review on one silly girls remark, but if you reverse that, there was no creativity in it, the only creativity involved was part of the tarnishing of the past of REAL people who were on the boat, the man who shot himself for killing a passenger, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! He gave his life to save others... Where is the conscience of the Hollywood pigs who tainted this guys past?

If Cameron could get any better after T2, he did a good job of attempting it here. in short, this is not your typical romantic drama.

The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancée of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else. Follow your heart, money does not bring happiness, believe immortal love etc.",/review/rw2222863/?ref_=tt_urv

But after hearing so many people triumphantly declare that they sat through the Titanic twice, four times, ten times, ect., I began to get upset.  There are a heck of a lot of better three hour movies they could have seen.  The truth is, Titanic is loaded with cliches and has problems with historical accuracy.

It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack.

4 December 1999,VicDawg,3," Am I the ONLY one who didn't care for this one?
","Let me explain by picking this flick apart.  Beginning: good, established the ""characters"" nicely, set a decent pace.  It's all downhill from there, folks!  Leonardo DiCaprio's performance could only be described as a poor imitation of a twelve year old doing a poor imitation of Clark Gable (he should at least be happy that I said they're names in the same sentence), and Kate Winslet was either too subdued or, well, way too subdued.  Don't get me wrong, the beautiful costumes and lavvish sets were awe-inspiring. I do admire James Cameron's attention to detail.  I also admire James Cameron's ability to direct an exciting action/adventure film, and therein lies the heart of the problem: this is not an action /adventure film. When the boat was sinking it played more like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Hypothermia than a tragedy of epic proportions, and the fact that the two leads didn't seem scared during the whole ordeal didn't help matters much. To be fair I did, however, enjoy the Band, the old couple in bed, the architect turning back the clock, the captain enduring the oncoming surge.

This movie is not insanely clever. It is not particularly intellectual. It certainly is not modest and yes it is embarrassingly commercial and almost prides itself for being 'Hollywood junk'.

Whilst the talent gathered (Winslet, Zane) hinted at true acting ability (they have provided far better performances in other films), the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl Mills and Boon. The technical effects have obviously been done to high standards, as the boat looks impressive, but that is where it ends, as the man-child DiCaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines, as makes the romance seem cliched and below par.

I also hate how much of a copy this was of almost every simple romance story, Girl about to marry snob, meets slightly poor, funny guy, falls in love, something prevents, then at end they are together. It was probably as simple as it gets. I also hate how farfetched the plot was. If Cameron had done ANY research prior to writing it, he would have realized how a romance like that would have NEVER happened. During 1910's American & England people married and dated within their economic class.

","Banal, crass, slushy, unoriginal, expensive, only won 11 Oscars as a `thank you' because if it had flopped the entire Hollywood studio system would have collapsed etc etc Yes all of these charges were and still are being laid against James Cameron's hugely expensive, multi Oscar winning epic. Times (and critics for that matter) never change because that is exactly the sort of thing people were saying back in the 50s and 60s with epics like Ben-Hur and look were they are in the cinema cannon. Having said that it is ironic then, Titanic is the sort of film people say they don't make anymore. It is true that some of Cameron's dialogue is not exactly Shakespeare, but everything else in the film more than makes up for it. DiCaprio and Winslet are perfect as the lovers crossing the class divide and bland lines aside Cameron's story is cleverly structured in developing the love story. From the dinner scene as Wisconsin boy DiCaprio holds his own against the snobs he's sitting with, to the detailing of the sinking itself. Cameron as director triumphs totally. At three hours long, the film feels more like 90 minutes, the recreation of the Titanic, both afloat and going under is brilliant, spectacular and thrilling. Cameron coaxes superb performances from his cast, with Zane the stand out among the supporting players as a nicely nasty villain and James Horner's beautiful music score enhances the mood of the film perfectly. Titanic hits all the emotional targets with more inspiration that is common among today's big budget films and the amount of effort that has gone into it, from the acting and not just the production is there for all to see.

The cinematography and the score are simply outstanding. A lot of people criticize Titanic because it didn't follow the real characters on the ship. Well, guess what. This was not meant to be a documentary. It was meant to be a fictional story set against the historically accurate background of the Titanic. Some people have tried to say that the movie was not accurate like Walter Lord's book. I have read the book, and Cameron must have memorized it to match the details so well. Besides, Lord wasn't even entirely accurate. His first book had the ship going down in one piece. Well, to all the critics of Titanic, I have this to say: If you want to go raise $200 million and make your own version of Titanic, you can do it however you want to. Cameron got the bucks for this, and it is his vision of the story. I happen to think it was money well spent.

With all of the hype and accolades, I expected a masterpiece from director James Cameron. Instead, I watched a boring drama with poor acting. First of all, in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cannot act. Perhaps with different lead actors I would have liked the film, but with those two actors playing Jack and Rose the movie began to sink -- like the Titanic. Secondly, perhaps it was just my eyes, but everything seemed brand new on the set. I realize that the Titanic was a new ship, but even at the beginning of the movie, the place where Jack was playing cards, his clothes, etc. all seemed impeccably clean. That feature didn't really make the movie bad at all, but was a detail that stood out for me. Then, of course, there is the length of the movie itself -- about 3 hours. After the first hour I could (and almost did) fall asleep, wake up an hour later and not have missed anything. The movie drags on forever...in the end, I was left wondering how the movie could be so popular. I honestly didn't find it emotionally-moving at all.

","The special effects of this film are some of the best I have seen in a movie. The great Titanic slipping under the waves, the people staying aboard for as long as they can, the individual stories of the famous people that were really on the ship (Molly Brown for example), The Capitans refusal to slow the ship down due to iceberg warnings and so on. Most of us know the story of the great liner that sank on that cold April night. Taken as that alone James Cameron's film is a masterpiece. You really feel like you are on the real Titanic with the people of the time. The problem I have with this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Say what you want but I feel he was mis-cast. He does not even try to act in a way you would expect a man of 1912 to act with his squeaky voice, saying things like horse-^*@% and I know how the world works. In other words he acts like he just came from a day at the beach. Kate Winslet is better in her role as Rose Bukater but I would have preferred a different actress. She plays the part mostly as someone who needs to grow up. The love affair between the two main characters is not believable and serves only as a distraction. Granted just showing the history of the famous ship with the people who were really there would have been boring for most young viewers without some modern story they could relate to. In this case a cheesy love story. Aside from that this film pretty much works. I watched it for the story of the Titanic and the actions of the crew that night, and the mistakes that were made that lead up to the disaster. Cameron crafted this part of the film so you felt that you were really there. Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater seemed out of place....",/review/rw2107258/?ref_=tt_urv

After watching it for 3 times already in my life, i still can't believe i've seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film, with such an incredible realism. I heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship, well i haven't noticed any, everything looked so real, all the people that were falling and screaming for help. The fictional story about the 2 main characters, falling in love, is genially directed, some of the scenes are very touching, very well filmed.

Him and Kate Winslet both did a great job, there's no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever.

","I'll start by saying Titanic was in no means a bad movie but I thought there were way to many flaws in this film to be Oscar worthy... In my opinion Kate Winslet was far from her best when it came to acting in this movie. She said Jack's name ( Leonardo Dicaprio) way to much like everyone watching would forget it or something it was really annoying. I also found later on when there running from that guy who was like Billy Zanes Characters assistant or w.e and after they loose him later on they go back up and he plants the heart of the sea diamond on Jack and the fact Rose believed he stole it after willing to leave her life for him just really bother me because if it was true love she would of trusted her so called love of her life!! That made me real annoyed also. Then when the ship is sinking and she finds out its a lie and goes after him, Rose and Jack go all the way back up from the basement of the ship and find a life boat but they wouldn't let Jack on and he tells her he will find away which he probably would since his character is pretty savvy but instead she jumps back on to the sinking boat, Like what the heck! Now that made me mad...Finally the last thing that no movie has made me feel such anger and disgust was the scene when there in the water and Rose is on that door and poor Jack is in the water shivery his butt off after all he did for her and instead of switching or taking turns she just hogs the whole door till he's dead.

","I have read a great many of the comments posted regarding ""Titanic"". Needless to say, I've come face to face with platitudes of spiteful criticism. The film's detractors seem to be beating the same arguments into the ground: length, DiCaprio, special fx, Cameron's ego, cliche'd dialogue. Not to say that these are all valid points (to a degree), but arguing the film's cliche'd machinations is essentially becoming a cliche within itself. Moreover, I notice a steadily- increasing lack of originality in the complaints; words like ""awful"" and ""stupid"" and all sorts of loaded language season every dissenting word. I have yet to see a concise, beautifully-articulated dissent, one that can explain contempt towards the film in a meaningful, intelligent manner. Allow me to conclude with three final points: (1) to dismiss the film as an overblown love story would be a pompous, arrogant thing to do; a disservice to the tragedy that the fictional tale is centered around; (2) James Cameron may be a lot of things, but he is not, by any shape or form, a bad director -- he's a competent technocratic director, not yet in the same league as Spielberg and Lucas, but he weaves tales that emphasize human emotion above human ingenuity, and he does it in a way that puts the likes of Bay, Bruckheimer, Emmerich and Devlin to shame, and; (3) Titanic is not ""the most overblown, over-rated film of all time"" - that title goes to Larry Clark's ""Kids"".",/review/rw0436293/?ref_=tt_urv

19 January 2022,DemurraNasty,10," Phenomenal success
","According to the press, Cameron got the idea for the picture after watching a documentary by James Ballard from the National Geographic series, filmed in 1987 and telling about a trip to a liner resting on the ocean floor. However, before the realization of the idea, the eminent director-screenwriter created not only the ""Abyss"", where the action takes place under water, but also the expensive futuristic action movie ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", only after that he managed to convince the management of two majors, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures, to agree to mind-blowing costs (eventually the budget was a record $ 200 million), which predicted a grand catastrophe in advance. But Cameron still did not back down and, moreover, remained faithful to the initially chosen course: that is why the main action is framed in ""Titanic"" by a prologue and an epilogue telling about a group of researchers trying to find out at least some details of the crash. However, the secret of the phenomenal success of the film without exaggeration around the world (the total box office totaled over $ 1.8 billion, of which only $ 600 million was in North America) lies in something else. Unlike the creators of almost all previous versions, Cameron outlined the story taking into account the rather strict requirements of what is commonly called - certainly with capital letters! - Big Hollywood Style. His brainchild can be considered a contribution of overseas cinematographers of the end of the XX century to that glorious tradition, with which, first of all, the products of the ""factory of stars"" were associated in the minds of the mass audience throughout the century. ""Titanic"" fits perfectly into the typological series, including such names as ""The Birth of a Nation"", ""Ben Hur"" (even two versions, the 20s and 50s), ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Doctor Zhivago"", ""The Sound of Music"". On the one hand, the story is again based on a genuine event - and a significant, even fateful event. The author not only reproduces the circumstances of the tragedy in the most detailed way, but interprets it in a symbolic way as an ominous warning to humanity - a warning about those global cataclysms of a political, social, man-made and natural nature that soon hit the Earth. The dramatically increased possibilities of cinema allowed the audience to assess the true scale of what happened, to feel to the depths of the soul and clearly see what the iron tread of History is. However, on the other hand, making a reservation just in case, the director-screenwriter introduces a fictional character (Cameron insisted on the candidacy of DiCaprio, then little-known), who turns out to be the main character of the entire romantic line, where fantasy, again according to custom, is not at all obliged to obey the facts. ""Titanic"", therefore, does not seem to be an innovative work, which, perhaps, it did not pretend to be. But Cameron cannot but be grateful for the contribution that he has made to the growth of the popularity of cinema all over the planet.",/review/rw7779075/?ref_=tt_urv

20 November 1998,jmcgraw7,," Not perfect but highly entertaining
","In some ways I can understand why some people hated this movie. I agree that it's overhyped and did not deserve either Best Picture or Best Actress. The love story was cliched and lame. Dicaprio's acting has seen better days (check out Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape for a true picture of his talents) though this wasn't really his fault, but Cameron's rather badly written script. And the script? Well--what can I say? It's really an action picture, after all. Some important details leading to the sinking were glossed over or totally ignored, such as the wireless operator's role in the tragedy, the Californian ignoring pleas for help, etc. However, the movie  is already quite long and in order to fit the love story in and develop the characters enough for us to care, much needed to be left on the cutting-room floor. Personally I don't have a problem with this. Documentaries and more historically realistic films about the Titanic have already been made. This is meant to be a Hollywood *movie*, not a documentary or even good art. Cameron never leads us to believe that he's trying to make it anything more than it is, and for what it is, Cameron's Titanic is an excellent movie. The only real problems I had was the under-development of certain characters, namely Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews. Both these characters were far more interesting in their small roles than the two leads, and it's too bad Cameron chose not to expand their roles even if it meant a *four-hour* movie. I would have gladly sat the extra hour. The other problem is the two leads. As I already said, Dicaprio may have been miscast, but his character was so inherently uninteresting and ""perfect"" that I doubt *anyone* could have done a better job. He did look weird next to the voluptuous Winslet, however. Someone with a bit more meat on their bones, perhaps, who looked slightly older? I don't know... As for Winslet, well, she's a good actress but Oscar material? Hmmmm. She seemed just a tad too, um, cheap and klutzy to pull off the role of a first-class young woman with any believability. A more refined and ethereal actress such as Claire Danes would have been a better choice. Also, these characters's speech seemed too ""modern"" for 1912...but I could be wrong here. As for the SFX, absolutely stunning and totally believable. I really felt what it must feel like to be on a sinking ship. The sequence with the band playing on as people either race about panicking or calmly succumb to their fate is extremely moving and made me cry more than anything Winslet or Dicaprio did. This, and the scene where the camera pulls back to show us thousands of people thrashing about in the freezing water (chilling in more ways than one!) are perhaps the best in the movie. Horner's soundtrack is moving and perfect, though I could have done without the dumb and overplayed Celine Dion song during the closing credits. Best of 1997? Maybe not, but definitely up there with my favorites.",/review/rw0436592/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just finished watching this on TV. It's easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated, then trashed as nothing more than a pre-teen chick flick. In truth, it's a lot like ""Dances with Wolves"", a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of Oscars, then p***ed everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film (for ""Titanic"" it was ""LA Confidential"", for ""Wolves"" it was ""Goodfellas""). I don't know if it was Oscar material, but it was definitely better than the critics now claim. On the plus side, no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect. I don't know how he did it, but James Cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real Titanic we were seeing. And the sinking scenes were amazingly real, enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer. On the minus side, far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. The story of the Titanic itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed. In short, this could have been THE film of the 1990's, instead it ended up as a good, but not great, money-making blockbuster.",/review/rw0436412/?ref_=tt_urv

","Hi, my name is Slim and I just saw a movie that cost enough to keep me and all my inbred cousins supplied with hooch and chips until the next millennium. We are talking big bucks here, so many millions that it makes even me drool. And here's the kicker: the plot of the movie can be summed up in about a dozen words. Poor boy and rich girl meet. They fall in love. Ship sinks. Some folks say there's all this other stuff about man vs. nature and man and technology and man and the haves and haves not, but all that stuff is about 15 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hours the film takes. So it doesn't really count. You know by now I'm talking about Titanic, made by the same guy who gave us the greatest Arnold Schwarzenegger flick ever made, Terminator, by James Cameron. Well, this time around Jimmy boy decides to make a movie where everyone knows the ending, so he can use all his creative juices and tons of dollars from who knows where to build a 3/4 size replica of the ship. None of those miniatures for Jimmy boy, oh no he wants the real thing. So we got lots of nice shots of the ship sailing in the ocean, shots from above and to the side and above and from the side and oh hell you've seen one you've seen them all. Too bad whenever the shots go into the ship and onto the ship and show what is going on you realize you've seen all that before also. As I said, everyone knows what happens to the ship. And to most of the people on it. Not much suspense here. We got rich folks strolling about, with the women wearing these hats that could be used as landing fields for seagulls; we got teeming masses of humanity dancing and drowning, but not at the same time; we got lust and the two backed beast between the poor boy and rich girl; we got lots of people going swimming against there wishes in the dark and cold ocean; we got the star of the show sinking and sinking and sinking, but being brought back to life by the wonders of modern day technology.

","I rented this a while ago with very high expectations. After all, it is the highest grossing movie of all time (as of the time of this writing). I was left pretty disappointed. That's not saying the movie is without its perks. The special effects are breathtaking. You can tell that lots of time, money, effort, and care were put into creating them. The special effects are about all there is to the movie. The story really isn't too bad, but how many ways can you tell the same story? A rich girl meets a poor boy and fall in love. Her parents disapprove. Not really ground-breaking. The story has been told better many times before. The acting is pretty mediocre. Leonardo is definitely just there for his looks. If they had casted a good, but not as attractive an actor, would the movie have grossed as much as it did? I think not. I know about twenty girls who saw the movie fifty times each to see Leo's face. Kate Winslet isn't as bad, and the remaining actors do fairly well. It's just no surprise this didn't win any awards for acting. Length is also a problem. If the movie were half as long, I'd like it more. The boat sinks for over an hour! It looks good, but it could have easily been cut down. As Kevin Murphy might say, ""It's like they have two servings of tension and they're stretching it out for seven people"". It just strikes me kind of funny that the ""Best film ever made"" failed to win academy awards for best actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, OR screenplay. On the whole, there are worse ways to spend your time, but the best film of 1997 should have been won by ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""As Good As it Gets"" instead of this.

There were so many historical inaccuracies that I lost interest within 1 hour. Needless to day, I wish I could have those 3 hours back. The film attempts to cross modern survivor recalls past theme. It doesn't work. The movie was not art in anyway. When a director is spending 200 million, I have a right to expect a little more than a love story that is a) historically impossible(upper class NEVER married nor dated lower) and b) horrible acting. To this junk get all those Oscars is a crime. How could something like this win over Gandhi and The Last Emperor. Those are art films that didnt need a huge budget. The Titanic in short, is nothing more than a ""chick flick"". No art, no talent, no screenplay, makes for one giant piece of junk.",/review/rw0437451/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the past, I was unable to comprehend Jack; I always assumed that he was a romantic lad with liberal ideas who enjoyed leading an unrestrained life. The maxim ""To make each day count"" appealed to me because I desired adventure and independence. There is no purpose in focusing only on love because life is harsh and not a haven for those looking for pleasure. Thinking back on the entire movie, Jack's words and deeds eventually made it clear to me that he is the one who knows the most about love and life. He was the one who taught Rose how to love and live her life to the fullest. In addition to being Rose's lover, Jack Dawson served as her spiritual supporter. He cared for her until she was grey and helped her recall when she was unable to walk anymore: ""There was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me in every way that a person can be saved.""",/review/rw8932087/?ref_=tt_urv

They were fantastic in the 'Romeo/Juliet', star-crossed lovers type. There's been several comments regarding the scene towards the end where Kate (Rose) is seen on a wardrobe (with room for Leonardo) (Jack) to be saved with her. I guess the script didn't call for Titanic Pt 2 because, had it, no doubt Jack too would've survived. Billy Zane didn't disappoint as the villain. I didn't cry but I was moved by the reality of the sinking. It must've been truly horrific knowing there was so many who perished in this sinking. I have since found whenever I see a photo of the Titanic, I can actually hear the screams of despair. I saw 'Raise The Titanic', no way is it comparable to this movie. Raise The Titanic had many people believe she sunk intact, when, in fact, she was literally torn apart and crumbled as she sank.

","Having been a fanatic of the Titanic story for as long as I can remember I was tickled with anticipation when I heard Titanic was coming to the big screen.When I finally got to see it in December of 1997 I wasn't disappointed.James Cameron did an incredible job in recreating this story down to the finest detail.Casting only people who physically resembled the original passengers and crew was a risky move(could they act?)but it paid off.His attention to detail was incredible.Even the napkins on the dining tables were monogrammed with the White Star Lines insignia.The scene on the boatdeck where a young boy is spinning a top while his Father looks on is taken from an actual photograph taken by a passenger.The scene where Captain Smith is discussing lighting the last four boilers with Bruce Ismay and in the background are two women passengers sipping on lemon tea,it is based on the original event-there really were two women sitting behind the Captain and Ismay on that day in 1912,they survived to tell the story. The movie does have rather banal dialogue in parts,but this is it's only failing.It's three hour running time seems to fly by and the scenes of the sinking were nothing less than spectacular.The scene where Officer Moody shoots himself after shooting two third class passengers made me wince a bit though.This scene is based on conjecture,there is no real evidence that it actually happened.Personally,after years of researching the story,I think he may have fired his pistol,but into the air,not at passengers.I guess Cameron added it in to create more intensity,but really,there was enough going on as it was. To me,the romantic storyline between Leonardo Dicaprio(originally Cameron wanted Brad Pitt) and Kate Winslet is secondary to the spectacle of the actual Titanic story.They do have a chemistry,and their courtship was plausible,and it certainly helped the tears flow at the end of what was an already sad story.Not to be emotionally moved by the films last half an hour would take a stout heart indeed. It is truly a tear-jerker. This film only really works though on a big screen(no less than 29"")and with digital surround sound.I have watched it on a 21"" tv without Dolby sound and the effect is flat. James Horners score is perfect for this movie and comes in at just the right places.My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion was a risk that paid off dividends for Cameron who originally didn't want vocals in any of the films soundtrack,he wanted the music to speak for itself.It would have been a lesser film without it.

","Right off the bat, I'd like to say that in general, I think that three hour long movies have a tendency to repeat certain parts of its plot over and over to reach its intended length( See, The Thin Red Line) However, Titanic's producer and director James Cameron managed to do a noteworthy job of avoiding this snag. Unfortunately he made a bad movie in the process. Kate Winslet did a formidable job, excuse the phrase, of trying to keep Titanic afloat. Her efforts were hampered by her thoroughly unbelievable lover Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). His ""poor boy"" image was hampered by his less-than-rugged good looks. For a troubled kid who is supposed to lead a rough life, he hardly looks the part. Hollywood's traditional technique of making a male look more 'rough around the edges' (smearing a little mud on their cheeks and tussling the hair) fails miserably on DiCaprio, mainly due to his flawless face and hair. After two minutes of standing in the mist of the bow of the Titanic, he looks frustratingly like the Leo we see walking around town. The film tends to drag on when it could have been accomplished in little over two hours. By the time the film is over, the fact that the movie is longer than it took the actual boat to sink seems much more believable.",/review/rw0436707/?ref_=tt_urv

I seem to remember lengthy movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Ryan's Daughter"" or of course ""Gone With The Wind"" coming with an intermission roughly halfway through but there's no such break here as Cameron knows that by the time the water starts to pour into the stricken ship, no one will want to leave their seat.",/review/rw7428567/?ref_=tt_urv

Don't get me wrong I like Horner but, he's only written three soundtracks in his life, he just recycles them to fit other movies.

Don't get me wrong, I liked Titanic, it's an enjoyable movie but I think the praise is a little over the top.  Cameron is not fit to lace Steven Spielberg's boots when it comes to directing and it's tragic that in a world with Morgan Freeman that anyone with a brain can mention Leo as the best actor in the world.  .  .I'm talking to all you teenage girls out there! So let's raise a glass to get ready to toast George Lucas and that golden moment when Star Wars episode one kicks Titanic's ass at the box office. Cheers!",/review/rw0436716/?ref_=tt_urv

I LOVE the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack & Kate Winslet's Rose (you just don't see romances like that anymore, which is a shame). I enjoy watching their romance grow until the very end. James Cameron was right in making sure that the audience gets an ""emotional doorway"", to use his words, to realize just how tragic the Titanic disaster really was by having them, as well as Jack & Rose, go through the events that led to the sinking . . . Did Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) ever do stuff like the things Jack did for Rose, risking his life because he loved her so much? I don't think so, because he didn't really care about her, or even love her for that matter . . . so Billy Zane did a fantastic job at portraying this character you just love to hate! All the other actors in this film, particularly Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart, & Bill Paxton, did fabulous as well. The scenery, the music (makes me cry even if I hum a few bars), the costumes, etc are FABULOUS!

","When I first saw this film, I left the theatre with a sense of awe, overwhelming sadness, and a deeper appreciation for the delicate position of human nature.  Like many people though, I was too quick to judge the greatness of this movie without weighing it objectively. Titanic is the work of a brilliant, gifted director who belongs in the halls of greatness with those of Welles, Hitchcock, Spielberg, Scorcese, and Coppola.  You could feel the sweat and blood that James Cameron devoted to this spectacular picture.  If Titanic deserved any Oscars, it was for Best Direction. I think that any award bestowed after that is riding the popularity wave. I think it deserved a nomination for Best Picture, and it probably was the best of those nominated, but the category itself was weak.  What happened to Amistad, or Contact?  Those movies both impressed more than Titanic.  I laughed when Kate Winslet was nominated.  For what talent?  I'm glad the Academy didn't get too carried away and nominate the entirely overrated Leonardo Dicaprio.  Gloria Stuart was a nice surprise, and she lost unfairly to Kim Basinger.  But so did everyone else in that category. True, it suffered from bad writing, but there's only so much you can write with the sinking of a ship looming over everyone. Many consider this the best ever -- those who do are either teenage girls and boys (whose appreciation for fine cinema doesn't extend beyond Grease) or past generation hermits who leave the house just for groceries and evening cribbage.  Anyone else who does need only sit and think about the ""greatness"" of Titanic for awhile.. but, still a movie worth treasuring and preserving forever.",/review/rw0436563/?ref_=tt_urv

The film is also filled with completely two dimensional characters which I guess I supposed to reflect the times, with the segregation between the rich and the poor. Even so, the characters such as the one played by Billy Zane as Rose's rich husband to be, are just lazily written with no character other than ""I'm-rich-and-I-hate-the-poor-toff-toff"".

","I have long been interested in the Titanic since reading Walter Lord's great book ""A Night to Remember"" over 30 years ago.  I loved the film made from the book and own it.  So, I was interested when ""Titanic"" hit the screen. However, this film just didn't do it for me as a whole. I found the love story between Jack and Rose unconvincing.  I really found the whole character of Rose hard to take.  While recognizing that she was in a bad spot, she came off to me as so egocentric and petulant that there were times when I felt like she deserved Billy Zane (great as a nasty.  Billy Zane has the perfect looks for the early 20th century parts).  So when she hops in the sack with Jack, it looked like a nice fiery diversion that probably wouldn't have lasted two weeks once the boat docked.

","Over its three-hour runtime, Titanic represents a gigantic cinematic achievement. And while the first half takes on the responsibility of establishing the presence of all the faces that we will follow, their relationships and the tragedy that is announced, the second part is responsible for the definitive test of how much we have been involved up to that point and how far Cameron's heavy hand with his team was justified. The whole act of the ship succumbing after colliding with an iceberg takes about an hour or so of projection, and with all this time in hand, Cameron elaborates his opera of despair, tears and the true portrait of the dimension of the facts, of solidarity vs. Need for survival, greed vs man's unpreparedness and overconfidence. ""Not even God could sink that ship"", says someone at one point, and Cameron is keen to keep this line of dialogue as an uncomfortable irony about the representation of power that the Titanic gave to those responsible and how their fate symbolized their downfall. And how several lives had to pay together for it. Cameron does not make this explicit in dialogues, but through situations while the ship sinks that make it impossible for the public to remain impassive in the face of the fact that, yes, the fate of the RMS Titanic could have been different.",/review/rw8767821/?ref_=tt_urv

Jack has nothing to offer Rose, and he knows it. That's all I can say without getting too detailed. Basically, every part of this film was wonderful. It was delicate and it was sad. I recommend that you watch this. If you like sad and romance, this is definitely a movie for you. I usually don't like sad movies, but this movie has turned me to it, instead against it.

","There is a backlash brewing, especially amongst imdb fans who suddenly brought Titanic down from the #1 ranking to out of the top 250. Fine, you win. The film will just have to settle for the all time box office record and tied for the most Academy Awards. It is interesting that most of these Titanic haters did not see the film when it first came out, and didn't even see it in theatres at all. The longer you waited to see the film, the more difficult it would be to watch it objectively. Many of these Titanic haters never wanted to see the film to begin with and went out of their way to tear it down when given the opportunity to finally see it. Those of us like myself who saw the film in theatres during the early weeks were able to watch it more objectively. I expected it to be well directed and technically impressive. James Cameron directed The Terminator, the most intense and relentless thriller I have ever seen. Aliens redefined the sci fi/horror film. What I was not expecting was that I would be crying at the end of Titanic, the first film to make me cry since Ghost. As a man, one who loves Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, L.A. Confidential, etc., I was caught completely off guard and became very emotional during the last half hour of the film. I cannot explain it and don't want to explain it, but I will never forget this film because it somehow got these feelings outside of my otherwise stoic self. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart broke my heart, and James Horner's score perfectly set the mood for me. I paid to see the film several times (and sneaked in to see the ending many more times.)  The total amount of time and money I put into watching this film is a bargain compared to the many hours of therapy sessions I otherwise could have had. The feelings the film inspired in me (normally well hidden) has since enabled me to become a more open, emotional, giving, well rounded person. That is the highest praise I can say of this film.

Kate Winslet's Rose could have been like any rich person on the ship and Leo's character you don't have any record of just like you didn't have records of some of the real people that got on the ship by mugging passengers before they got on it.  So who cares if they are fake?  How dumb of an excuse is that to criticize this movie? ""Waste of 200 million""  yeah yeah right sure, not one of you could have come even close to making this the film it is.  ""Leo sucks""  now you are just full of jealousy and since Leo is an overrated actor (I admit that he is) that since he's in the movie you have to say it's horrible.  Well for those of you who actually think that he is like the same character he is in The Man in the Iron Mask why don't you actually watch this movie because those of you that have said why it sucks is because of Leo have obviously not seen it.  His acting and many others are great in the film, ok maybe not outstanding but nor were the ones in Gone With The Wind, you just make them out to be.  ""All special effects"" yeah ok here are another group of people that didn't see the movie because the special effects don't really kick in into the last half hour of the film is with all those effects that you would actually notice to criticize.  They are throughout the film but they are so clear you don't realize it.  So why don't most of you just give it a rest because none of you have any idea what you are talking about you just figure since Titanic is the biggest film around you should criticize it.  You aren't Siskel and Ebert so no one really cares about your closed-minded opinions.  Some of you may feel it was overrated but just because of that dosen't make it suck.  I don't know one person or have seen one of your reviews that have gave such a real reason to criticize it.  It's only problem was the script and it wasn't a real problem.

It would have made an okay movie, but the cliche's were heavy enough to sink the ship even if it hadn't hit the iceberg. Chances are, the reason this film was so successful is because it crudely slams together all the various concepts that other successful films have used. They include #1: Romance between rich and poor, #2: Stuffy rich folk, happy, free poor folk. #3: An adventurer, world-travelling lead male character. #4: A husband-to-be for the main male character's romance, with a tendency to be abusive. #5: A historical setting. #6: The romance genre done very sappily. #7: Attempts at making the audience cry by showing scenes of various tragedy in case the sappy romance plot fails to make one cry, so that people will call it touching. The list goes on and on, but unlike so many others, I'm afraid I'll have to chuck this entire film and all it's content in the ""It's been done."" area.

","A 7.0? Are you kidding me? I have read all the comments on this movie and let me say, there is just absolutely no need for them. Isn't it funny how in the winter of 1997 everybody was going to see this movie, some multiple times, helping it become the highest-grossing movie ever and now they all hate it? I feel bad for Cameron, hopefully he never gets on this website and reads this crap, because he is very talented. Tell me what, exactly, is bad about this movie? Every single excuse I've heard for people hating it are biased opinions based on stupid things. They say they don't like it because of Leo. Okay, there are about a dozen other actors BESIDES Leo here. And he wasn't even that bad, come on, get a freakin' grip! A little note to people who get on here and TRY to be movie critics: you don't rate a movie on the likeability of an actor. That's a selfish OPINION. It's like saying ""I hate Pretty Woman because Julia Roberts wears a red dress and I hate red."" Please. Sure, I get the fact that the love story is somewhat cheesy. But that's only in certain parts of the movie and the movie is over 3 hours. Some more advice: don't rate a movie in pieces. Commenting on the beginning love story and the end with the sinking, what is that all about? A movie is one whole piece of work. How can you just show a ship sinking and not set it up first with a beginning? Everything about this film is spectacular. The music, the sets, the effects, the themes. It shows how Titanic not only changed the world, but the very lives of the people on it. If you'll notice at the end, none of the characters ever really recovered from it. The love story is essential to take you on the inside of the tragedy and see it how people that were actually there saw it. From a victim's eyes. And if you laughed at this movie, then your heart is as cold as the iceberg that sank this ship. Do you laugh when a bomb goes off, killing people? I hope not. 1500 people DIED on this ship, many suffering one of the most horrible deaths (drowning) and never even getting a chance to save themselves. Those that didn't drown were tortured by freezing to death. Stick your hands in ice water and tell me how you would feel being totally immersed in it, slowly dying. Children and babies died. Think about that and tell me how cruel someone has to be to laugh at that. Cameron makes you feel for the people on the ship, something other Titanic movies failed to do. By creating characters we care about and ripping them apart, he creates a true tragedy. It's not a comedy. The last hour is one of the most exhilarating movie experiences of all time. And so is this movie. This is possibly the only case in which a film once so popular will go down forever as being ""gay and a piece of trash.""

","I'd like to proudly join the ranks of the minority who found this film to be a tedious, silly, childish serving of ridiculous pap interesting only to juvenile sensibilities. Aside from the presence of the genuinely talented DiCaprio and some admittedly visually striking scenes of the boat's sinking, the film (as any film is) is absolutely mortally impaired by Cameron's Jack and Jill simple script of poor but good boy loves rich but trapped in evil high society girl who are then tragically parted by cruel fate while their love is still young, sweet and fresh. If only genuine real life were actually like this perhaps films like this could be enjoyable, but any sensitive, perceptive mature adult knows that (perhaps unfortunately) that it just ain't so. Cameron is certainly, though, an extremely talented action director with the directing credits of Aliens and Terminator 2 to his name, he just shouldn't write his own scripts as in this department his insight and understanding of the depth and complexity of the genuine human experience is seriously lacking. I'll just keep rewatching Aliens and T2 and hoping that Cameron hires Frank Darabont (who wrote The Shawshank Redemption) to write his scripts, or stays firmly in the director's chair.",/review/rw5211735/?ref_=tt_urv

I thought Cameron's Terminator2 was an extremely moody, atmospheric piece of work with consistently interesting camera work and plot. Titanic looks like the ABC movie of the week...with worse dialogue...and what exactly was Kathy Bates doing in this film besides flying across the screen once in a while speaking nonsense?  Apparently many pre-teens and early-teens flocked to this film five and six times each!  I have to believe this was for the most part the intended audience.

","I know everyone is sick of reading about how the simple plot is wonderful and Kate and DiCaprio did a nice job with their roles.  Of course these are all true. However, no one has ventured to ask why this movie is the greatest of all time.  The key?  The haunting musical score of James Horner.  It takes all the effects and images and gives them meaning and emotion. Without his score (even John Williams probably could not have done it better), the movie would have lost a serious amount of the magic it held for me and the majority of the American public.  From the trademark flashback scene in the beginning to the life boats at the end, Horner's music captivated the emotions of the people and the tragedy of the shattering of a supposedly ""unsinkable era.""  Consequently, DONT buy the video unless you plan on buying a surround sound system.

Even the dialogue is interesting and relatively witty in the parts about the ship and the characters other than Jack and Rose, while all conversation between the two lovers is boring and naive.  I am surprised there wasn't much effort in creating a more mature and deeper love story, especially with the effort put in the movie as a whole.  James Cameron  did a very good job directing the ship and her sinking, characters like Moly Brown were amusing but there was nothing special about the main characters.

Titanic simply adopts this recipe and puts her on board an ocean liner (just like the Poseidon) where she presents us with the classic love triangle where tragedy will cut love at the finest thread. In all a declaration of principles it is easier to survive when you are rich and debauched than when you are poor and sensitive. The film lacks originality and the only thing decent is the sequence of chaos and destruction and you need to watch a lot of bland footage to get there.

","The sinking of the Titantic is actually quite interesting, as anyone who has read a well-written book about the event can tell you.

In the end, Cameron's film so far removed from reality that it's unlikely anything it contains would ever be taken seriously by anyone looking for the historical facts. I mean, when was the last time Hollywood presented real history? Probably 1964 when they filmed The Longest Day, whose script was religiously close to Cornelius Ryan's book. Since then, not much. The fact that Cameron had to make up a subplot wouldn't have been so bad, had it remained a subplot to the story of the sinking, and had it been realistic rather than such a trite piece of romantic nonsense. Cameron had the opportunity to make a definitive account of this well-known event and totally blew it. To tell history you need someone who is dedicated to historical truth, not someone determined to make the audience reach for their collective handkerchiefs. Shame on you, Mr. Cameron.

That extra hour should have and could have been easily cut. As it is the film is a chore to get through and not a classic to revisit often; though the leads, Kate and Leonardo, have great performances, delivering a powerful romantic yarn, however these positives of ""Titanic"" are offset by the aforesaid over-indulgence in its own spectacle and grandiosity. This lack of self-restraint and efficient editing and storytelling really affect the second half of the film, making it almost unwatchable. Basically from the time the ship hits the iceberg the film suffers, it should have wrapped up with the catastrophe taking 20 minutes or so with a further 10 minute epilogue. But as it stands now at 3 and 1/4 hours it is obviously 60minutes too long. In summary, a famous film that probably appeals more to women, or young girls, than men, but it remains one of the great examples of a missed opportunity solely due to poor editing and pacing. My rating: 4/10. And the 100 year old lady should have been reciting the tale to her great-grandchild, not flying to a ship and telling a fortune hunter.

","Titanic, what has been called by some ""the best movie of all time"" and by others ""the worst movie of all time,"" is absolutely incredible! Not only is it a movie; it is an experience! Let me say, to begin, that I am a teenage boy, and practically every one of my friends laughs and scoffs at this movie, especially when they learn that I like it! I just can't believe my ears whenever I hear them say things like ""I've never been so bored in a movie in my life!"" or ""Dude, that ain't cool!"" or ""You can't like that movie!"" or ""What a disgrace to history!"" or ""I want my three hours back, along with my sanity!"" Each one of these quotes is direct and an accurate depiction of their feelings toward this magnificent work of art. There are so many things to be remarked upon in this film! First, let me say, that Leonardo DiCaprio is even more beautiful than Kate Winslet, which is definitely saying something! I completely understand and sympathize with all of the teenage girls who used to kiss their TV screens whenever he would appear. You ladies have wonderful taste! Furthermore, his performance was exactly what it should've been. It was dramatic when needed, subtle when required, sarcastic and glib when appropriate... There was absolutely nothing wrong with his portrayal of Jack Dawson. There were so many charming moments, like when Jack is teaching Rose how to spit, and he gets ready to spit a giant spit ball, and Rose's mother and mother's friends suddenly appear out of nowhere, or when he starts drawing his glowing portrait of the angel that is Rose DeWitt Bukater, and the beautiful, wordless piano lyric sweeps the viewer off their feet. It's the moments like that, so well-thought-out and well-put-together, that make this film stand among the greatest of all time.",/review/rw1882141/?ref_=tt_urv

8 June 2020,TheHonestCritic,4," This ""film"" is a failure of truly ""Titanic"" proportions!
","""Titanic"" (1997), okay, before you all freak out and get enraged, I will say this. James Cameron has a boatload of talent (NO PUN INTENDED), as a writer and a director. He has written and directed some phenomenal films! But, ""Titanic"" in my opinion, is by far his worst movie. It has an overlong and convoluted storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a dull cliched soundtrack. This ""film"" is 195 minutes in length. Now, the length of a movie can make or break it. I don't mind a long movie if the storyline keeps me hooked all the way through. The basic plot behind this ""film"" is that there's a love story and the Titanic sinks. A simple story like this should warrant 100-120 minutes max to express the storyline. Film Making 101: if you're planning on making a lengthy film, then you better be sure that you know what you're doing. Just because a movie is long, does not always guarantee it's going to be good. Remember the cardinal rule: less is more! You always want to leave your audience asking for more in the end. Therefore, your storyline will have a stronger impact. As for the acting, it's overall disappointing from all of the actors and actresses. However, there are two standouts though. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose are the only two that seem to actually be trying. Both of them are great actors! But, a poorly written storyline impeded them from truly giving it their all and allowing them to shine. Such a shame! Both of these two actors, along with the majority of the rest of the cast are great actors and actresses in other movies. What's their excuse here? Finally, the soundtrack is just a cliched, dull and predictable mess. However, there is one standout song from the score that isn't too bad. The song, ""My Heart Will Go On"" written by James Horner and then performed by Celine Dion is actually well-done. As for the rest of the music in this ""film"", it's just generic and boring. There are only two positives in this ""movie"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. The Titanic set is very well constructed and the rest of the locations give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. ""Titanic"" is a boring and lengthy ""movie"". Probably one of the worst things about it is that you know what's going to happen in the end right from the beginning. Talk about spoiling your own film! Sorry, James Cameron..... ""Titanic"" is just nothing but a jumbled mess. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Don't bother watching ""Titanic"", I don't care how much a film makes at the box office. Just because a movie makes a lot of money doesn't always mean it's automatically going to be a masterpiece. Awards mean nothing, because at the end of the day, what's most important is what you think. I just wish I could get those 195 minutes of my life back!",/review/rw5808865/?ref_=tt_urv

2 August 1999,Hamlet23,1," Greatest ever? Tell me another one.
","This movie might well be the most over-rated film of all time.  It had a few good points -- foremost among which was the cinematography -- but these were overshadowed by the shortcomings of the movie and the ludicrous hype that surrounded it.  The film is full of stock characters, with the stereotypical and cliched Jack and Rose being the most prominent examples.  The entire movie was as predictable as the boat sinking at the end.  The dialogue is sub-par, to say the least.  The movie drags on and on forever.  The scenes in the present, for example, were totally superfluous.  I remember watching the boat leave dock and staring at my watch, not believing that I'd only been there for half an hour.  And then the movie, like the boat, just kept going.  After the ship hits the iceberg, the movie improves -- it doesn't have time to waste, so it can't waste it.  Even here, though, there were just a few too many last-minute rescues for my taste. This movie tries to attain the epic quality of ""Gone with the Wind,"" but it simply can't do it.  It has very little substance, and lacks the art of that film -- an actual classic.  If ""Gone with the Wind"" is a bit soap-operatic -- a fair criticism, I think -- then sitting through ""Titanic"" is like sitting through all 20 years of ""As the World Turns"" in one sitting.  It is not an epic, it is simply long -- too long, and pretentious.  This is the ultimate Hollywood movie in that it has so little too offer, and yet somehow it cleaned up at the Oscars, wins all kinds of undue praise, and heap money on it until it becomes the highest-grossing movie ever.  I hope that, box-office records aside, this movie does not remain famous, or keep this silly reputation of being a classic.  It does not have the quality of any of the great films it is often compared to.  It is big-budget fluff. One final point: on the voting scale, I gave this movie a ""1.""  And I will be honest: it is not quite that bad.  It could be ""2"" or even ""3"" material. But the way some people talk about this movie absolutely drives me crazy. It is not a great love story, it simply imitates a lot of other ones.  It is a product.  It is a huge studio production without very much heart or brains behind it.  I find it very sad the way this movie (and its male star, who at this very moment is trying to trademark his name) have been made into such golden calves.  ""Titanic"" exemplifies the era of big-budget fluff that present-day movie-fans have to deal with.  Once people stop buying into movies like this, actual quality may return to film.  I only hope that that day comes soon.",/review/rw0436985/?ref_=tt_urv

The film Forrest Gump had brought in the most with over 300 million until this film came out. When you look at the list for highest grossing films now, Titanic shattered the numbers of Gump! This film is about a sinking ship and how there was only a few soul survivors. I mean come on!! There have been many great movies in this span of time but when you look at the numbers it kind of surprises you a little bit. The film was made by a brilliant director, and a wonderful cast, and won many awards. Within the first couple of weeks reached over 300 million which really is amazing. Still I wonder why own earth that this film did so well! Now in my opinion I do not really like Winslet or DiCaprio (aside from films like Departed) I will say that they worked very well, in this film. Another thing is the length of this film. The film is very long and winding. Did you really sit through this whole film when it was in the theaters? Again this is my opinion but personally I really had no interest when this film came out and had no interest in seeing it. I thought the original film is better, not what you see today. All of the special effects, graphics, etc. etc. I just find it so hard to believe that this film did so well, and no other film has been able to surpass it. Now when you look at other lists for movie production companies you will see that movies such as Star Wars, Pirates, Shrek 3, come to mind.

Lewis is skeptical because the records indicate that her last name is Dawson, and there is no record of a Mr. Dawson. Rose meets with the collectors searching for the diamond and begins a long tale. She makes them agree to sit through her story before giving up the diamond. She is old. I mean old. She explains that she was once engaged to a wealthy industrialist named Cal Hockley, who had a slippery henchman named Mr. Lovejoy. She wasn't in love with him, but her mother, Ruth, insisted the marriage happen to protect their social status and help them avoid financial ruin. Rose feels completely cornered, and without options. She attempts to kill herself, but is talked out of it by a young man named Jack. Jack is a traveling artist who gets by on his own wit. He has no money, but seems to get by somehow. He informs Cal, Ruth, and Mr. Lovejoy that he saved Rose's life. He wants to hang out with them all, mainly because he wants to sleep with Rose.

","This movie is without questioned great!! I find myself looking at it more than once; looking at the highlights; intrigued with the story as if I were there (thank GOD that I wasn't!!) I also rooted for Jack and Rose. Rose didn't love Cal. Rose was being pressured to marry him. A big message was being sent when we see Rose ready to kill herself because of how trapped she was. Her mom was pressuring her for one. Like Jack, ""I know how the world works"" when a man has nothing to offer a woman.....especially when he's compared to a man who can give her the world. But, just like the movie with a similar storyline, The Notebook, a woman like Rose has to ask herself ""what do you want?"" Like so many others I was glad to see Jack win Rose over. But unlike so many others, Jack's death didn't sadden me the most. Normally after living through and watching a big drama like this his death would have saddened me the most. But unlike so many I haven't forgotten that this is so true of a story!! Jack and Rose didn't exist. But Capt. Smith, the band, Isador & Ida Krauss, Thomas Andrews, and other characters who died on screen in the sinking did.....and so did 1500 plus people back in 1912. That so saddens me more; especially since it seems like the poorer passengers weren't able to get on a life boat. Molly Brown also existed. And researching real life coverage, Molly Brown really did want to go back and see if she could rescue more. I honor all of those who perished. The love story that should have been told should be that of the Krauss': Isador and Ida. Ida could have boarded a life boat be she didn't want to live with out her true love of many many years.

Nearing the end of the flight and the film during the promise scene between Rose and Jack with the line ""I'll never let go"" I mumbled ""let the buggar sink"" a little too loudly and was shushed loudly and got dirty looks. Sorry, but the line was so corny and the delivery was not believable.

","Ok let's be honest. I'm 17, and this movie is about 21 years Old. I've seen Hundreds of Hollywood Movies including Fictional, Romantic, Tragedies, Drama and Action. But this Movie is included in all the above Categories. And in all of that it has been ""The Number 1 Top grossing Blockbuster movie"" for over 12 years. The Director Mr. James Cameron has done brilliant Job in working on such a great Project. The Movie seems to look alive even after 21 years. The Effects used in the Movie are Outstanding even for the present day.
Actually, the reason why I wanted to give a review about this movie was that I loved the Fictional part of this Movie i.e. Jake and Rose. Cameron Has done a great Work in writting such a Wonderful And Fascinating Love story ever written. I've seen alot of Dramatic scene but, this Movie actually brought tears in My eyes. This Fictional Part of the Movie looks so real and Every scene that Includes Jake and Rose in it just trembles my Heart. The Theme song of this Movie ""My heart will go on"" just refreshes the soul and Gradually brings tears as we go on to listen it reminding about Jake and Rose. The Best scene was When Rose Survives and Reaches America, She looks at the Statute of Liberty city missing Jake. And a few moments later an officer asks Her name and she answers: ""Rose Dawson"" naming after Jake.
I think I'm gonna need a physiatrist hehehe because I've been Watching this movie 6 times consecutively. I just love this Movie so much. Leo and Kate are my Favourite Hollywood celebrities of All time. This Movie is never dying Master piece. Love You Jake and Rose <3.

It was believed to be unsinkable. Its passenger list was a microcosm of society, and the tragedy has fascinated each succeeding generation. Robert Ballard discovered it on the ocean floor in 1985 and recovered some of its contents. Ballad's effort inspired James Cameron to write and direct this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Jack and Rose. Movies do not get more romantic than this. Who can forget the image of Jack and Rose at the front of the ship?

9 January 2003,erich_hugo,1," Truly disappointing
","I am disgusted with this movie. Firstly I admit that the special effects are extra ordinary but what would you expect of James Cameron. Terminator and Aliens speak for themselves and when it comes to movie making Mr. Cameron certainly ranks in the top 10 of current film directors. Thus, being based on historical events the special effects cannot save this movie because how more earth shattering can a sinking ship be than.. well a sinking ship. What really made my mouth bitter was the vacuous script. I got the idea that Mr. Cameron enlisted the help of all the daytime TV-soap writers to write the most vapid script ever. It would have been appropriate if the movie was released with Written boards which states: At 30 minutes cry et al.  The thing is, this is a JUST ADD WATER SCRIPT. (Literally) It is so innocuous that one can place it on any setting (even Sabrina the teenage witch) Unfortunately I disagree with the fact that this movie had 'broad appeal' If you take into account the general sample of viewers on this board have seen the movie in excess of 5 times in the cinema, it whittles down the number of actual viewers considerably. Furthermore, with the current crop of cinematic wonders being released it is obvious that Directors do not need to under-estimate their audience as they are more intelligent than they get credit for (case in point the name change of Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone so that American audiences would know what it is about.) Instead of dumbing down audiences, directors should inspire audiences to understand the world better.

","I hesitate to write anything at all, since there are already more than 400 entries on this site. So let me just pop off the first few things that come to mind... 1)Hardly ""Best Picture"" caliber. As has already been noted, the dialog is ridiculous; the leads have no romantic chemistry; and - most shocking of all - the fx really aren't worthy of the hype. The sinking is impressively staged, but scenes of the Titanic underway don't seem much more credible than a lot of back-projected stuff coming out of Hollywood six decades ago. The computer-generated pans of the ship and the ocean are staggeringly obvious. 2)Billy Zane must give one of the most unbearable performances in film history. Granted, Cameron's script gives him nothing to work with; the viewer who noted he seems to be playing Satan has it just right. The scenes where he shoots (!) repeatedly at Jack on the Grand Staircase (wouldn't the list on the ship make it pretty damn hard to navigate the staircase by this point?) and uses a child to ensure his place on a lifeboat are just idiotic. I found myself grimacing every time I looked at Zane's sallow face and slanted eyes; this brand of villainy went out in pictures - I don't know - about the time of the real Titanic sank. 3)The leads are pretty hapless; and the fact they are able to spend so much time submerged in freezing water while unlocking doors, wielding axes, etc. beggars credibility. 4)A lot of the supporting roles are well-played. David Warner doesn't fall into the trap of over-acting like Zane does, and comes off quite well as the villainous valet. He seems to be having fun, which is pretty much all an actor can do in a flick like this. Gloria Stuart is extremely effective as Old Rose; she more-or-less singlehandedly endows the film with all its human pathos. I also enjoyed Bill Paxton's performance. He etched pretty effectively the character of a jaded adventurer. If only he had some decent dialog to work with. Victor Garber - a very fine actor - is wasted as Thomas Andrews. He is invariably excellent in all his scenes. 5)Folks who take umbrage to the fictional characters would do well to remember a similar framework was used with Clifton Webb and Barbra Stanwyck as an estranged fictional couple in Negulesco's 1953 Titanic. 6)WHERE WAS THE CALIFORNIAN? If you're looking for a movie villain, this ship fits the bill. The decision to cut scenes set on the derelict vessel is really regrettable. 7)On the whole, a decent, passable picture, with many striking images and a great last hour. But it pales in comparison with the 1958 ""A Night to Remember,"" which better captured the human drama of the ship's final moments. On the other hand, far better than the Stanwyck-Webb opus.",/review/rw0436829/?ref_=tt_urv

Mabye this is why the film made so much money, it is food for the masses.  I did enjoy the realism of the desperate hours on the boat but outside of that it all sucks. If you did not like this movie then I recommend that you see Bigas Luna´s ``The Chambermaid of the Titanic´´, a much more original piece that does not put us through the typical paces. If you liked Titanic then you will not enjoy Bigas´ effort. I was so embarassed when the audience clapped at the end of Cameron´s long film.

If the film would have had a good male lead, Titanic would have been almost as tragic as Saving Private Ryan (but in a different, less deep way).  Jack's death scene would have brought even me to tears.  As it is, I was sad, not because of Jack dying, but because of Winslet's heart-breaking reaction.

I felt like going to the restroom after staying in my seat for more than three and a half hours (counting trailers). One glaring aspect I personally do not like is Cameron's portrayal of the third class passengers being locked in their area.  This did not really happen in the true story of the Titanic.  Many famous people died on the ship and Cameron does not refer to this.  Instead, he plays on people's emotions to make them feel sorry for the third class passengers' misfortunes. Another setback I saw in the movie was DiCaprio's less than average acting performance.  He was not nominated for Best Actor for a reason and Kate Winslet was a poor match to put with him.  She looked a lot older than DiCaprio and her better acting ability made DiCaprio's acting look even more disparaging. Even with the movie hoopla, the teenage girl infatuations of DiCaprio, and the great box-office records it broke, Titanic is not one of the best movies of all time, but good enough for a night with a loved one.",/review/rw0436524/?ref_=tt_urv

I mean selfish! Self-centered! Narcissistic! And even when in the story she had the portrait made she left it behind with a note for her fiancé- she was just using Jack as a way to get back at the fiancé for his treatment of her as property.

","I agree that the first time I watched Titanic, I cried a lot and I still cry when I watch it. I watched that movie when I was pretty small, around 14, and I had no idea of the rating. Whenever I watch this movie, I do realise that the idea I had that it was one of the best movies ever made is not exactly true. Due to my age, I failed to notice faults, but now I can state where they are and how they spoil the movie. Firstly, I do not think Titanic deserved all those Oscars- and 14 nominations were just too much. So far, only three movies have had 11 Oscars and I think only one out of the three deserved more- ROTK. I think other movies such as Gone With the Wind, Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, My Fair Lady, FOTR, The Two Towers and a few other movies deserve to get so many Oscars.",/review/rw0437800/?ref_=tt_urv

","O.K., firstly, I loved this movie, I saw it and came out with the feeling that I, too had been aboard Titanic when she sailed and when she sank. The thing I can't understand is how people can go see a movie and do nothing more than look for mistakes or pick it apart. These people mustn't have very interesting lives or else they would enjoy things of quality such as this film. I have read through some of the comments on this page and feel compelled to answer some of the more lame statements. Firstly, Cal tried to shoot both Rose and Jack because as he stated to Jack,when Rose got into the lifeboat, ""I always win Jack, no matter what."" The first class attitude of the day was that. Cal was just showing his first class snobbery. Secondly, of course Rose should jump out of the lifeboat, her love for Jack was the catalyst for this. Now I own 2 other Titanic movies, one made in 1953, the other in 1958 and in both of these movies they show at least three women jumping back onto Titanic from the lifeboats. Some of the women on board Titanic truly didn't want to leave their husbands behind. I only hope that if I had to make a decision like that, then I would choose to stay with my husband as well. Thirdly, I am so sick of seeing people complain about this and any other film, unless you are an out of work producer, director or actor (and as such, you can't be too good at your craft if you are)then you truly should try to remember that these people put their lives on hold for nine months so that we could have a movie that we can be proud of.

","Whoever makes a movie about the most famous shipwreck of all time will inevitably run the gauntlet of criticism for this part or that part being correct/not correct. In general Cameron's version is a reasonably correct version of the known facts ( not including the two fictional lead roles ). Some points about the crews behaviour ( particularly Lightoller ), as shown in the movie are open to debate, however the whole truth will never be fully known. One fact that never seems to have been mentioned in any movie to date (that I know of) is that the White Star line was part of the American I.M.M shipping combine owned by American tycoon John Pierpont Morgan. The vessel was crewed by British officers to give the impression of a British operation. Therefore Morgan ( who was extremely proud of Titanic  and devastated by her loss ) would have taken a great interest in her specifications. Of course ultimately Captain Smith and those on board issuing orders must shoulder any blame for Titanic's sinking. Apart from disputes over historical facts the film is magnificent. Few directors would be able to control such a huge production as Cameron has. The set's are stunning and the computer graphics top of the line. The movie's 3 hours seem to pass very quickly. The love sub-plot is well constructed and ably acted ( although Leonardo Di Caprio seems a touch lightweight in places ).

The boy from the other side of the tracks, is traveling in steerage class, with the have-nots. Their relationship developes when the boy coaxes her not to end her wealthy and luxurious lifestyle by taking a dive over liner's stern into the Atlantic. She is invited to the steerage class by DiCaprio for a rave-up.  They wind up in the cargo hold; and the rear seat of a automobile. What happens next between them is inevitable. So, what's new? What happened between them had to happen before the iceberg butted in and upset everything for them and the rest of the passengers and crew. Special effects? Brilliant! They could not have been bettered. Director James Cameron poured all he had into this movie and it came up trumps. He richly deserves the plaudits. But as the great Billy Wilder stated.

","A friend asked me, ""Will the movie look exactly the same as 1997s version? "". I spontaneously told him, ""Well, the ship will still be sinking."". Ha ha But seriously, it's an unforgettable experience and definitely worth seeing! James Cameron invites us to revisit the RMS Titanic and thiz time in 3D. And you know what? I still get goosebumps ever since the first 10 minutes I saw thiz movie. I admit that everyone can make a review on ""Titanic"", surely everyone has something to say about thiz movie. It's not just that the ship is gigantic but also literally big as a movie. The Director James Cameron did explore almost everything. The real tragic event with the latest forensic science and one of the most beautiful stories ever told. Thiz is the man who brought you ""Aliens"" (1986), ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) and ""Avatar"" (2009). A simple adventurer Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) won a ticket in a lucky hand at poker for the journey of a lifetime, where he meets a desperate aristocrat Rose (Kate Winslet) who suffers anguish after being forced to marry a rich steel tycoon Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). The journey is going to change their lives forever. The other Cast members are Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber and Bernard Hill as Captain Edward James Smith. The cinematography is splendid. What I do remember is the dynamic camera movements, the afternoon sunshine, the wind, the wave, everything! I'm always impressed by how they capture the moment of ""I'm Flying Scene"", when Jack teaches Rose how to step over the big ship's prow and spread her arms wide. The chemistry seems so natural and sincere. The love story is compelling in every possible way. It's like ""Romeo and Juliet"" kind of thing. ""You Jump, I jump"" is also one of my absolute favorite moments. Yes, we do care about Jack and Rose. The elderly Rose who is played by Gloria Stuart also deserves mention for her memorable performance. Stuart successfully brings the story alive with her powerful storytelling. The song from Celine Dion, ""My Heart Will Go On"" is not just great, but it's legendary! Once again, it is worth watching in 3D. Although thiz re-release version is the conversion result from 2D standard material to 3D, but it's your best chance to experience the magical wonder which feels like you're actually standing on the deck of Titanic. One day you can proudly tell your kids or even grandchildren that you saw ""Titanic"" in the theater. Yes, thiz will be a historic moment! I have to say, I love the ending. It's one of the greatest ending scenes in cinematic history. Spoiler Alert! After the elderly Rose passes away, in afterlife somehow she's young again and meets the love of her life Jack at staircase in the main lobby of the Titanic. Then they're just kissing. It's so sweet and overwhelming. The movie reminds us that nothing is eternal, but still a specific moment can be eternal in our hearts. So are you ready to go back to Titanic?

","Titanic from 1997 is a wonderful movie. It really is. For me it's such a guilty pleasure because even though it's good, it is definitely clichéd and the love story in it is so ridiculous. But how can you not love this film? This movie has everything. Violence, nudity, sex, a love story, romance, disaster and special effects. The story line is pretty simple. It's about the Titanic, the ""unsinkable"", biggest ship in the world, at the time. On the morning of April 15, 1912, it hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sinks to the bottom of the ocean in less than three hours. Over 1,000 of the 2,000 passengers on board are killed. Pretty simple, right? Well, to add to the drama, there's a love story involved. Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet, is a wealthy young heir who is engaged to the handsome and rich but arrogant and controlling Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane. One night she decides to try and commit suicide by jumping off the boat. A poor loner named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, sees what she's about to do and coerces her into aborting her decision. As she's climbing back over the railing, she slips and nearly falls into the icy ocean. Jack grabs her arm and pulls her to safety. But two of the ship's crewmen hear her screaming and come to her aid. They see Jack on top of Rose and think he has done something awful to her. He is about to be punished until Rose convinces Cal, her fiancé, that Jack was only saving her after she slipped while looking at the propellers. And from then on Jack is infatuated with Rose. She has stolen his heart. Even though Jack has no money and no ambitions, Rose can't help but fall equally in love with him. He is sweet and charming. After a sweaty fling in a car at the bottom of the ship, the couple go up on deck and embrace. It is then that they see the iceberg and the ship hits it.",/review/rw1623056/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is the most overrated movie of all time.  I know that it sweeped the Oscars for the year 1997, but that doesn't mean that it deserves to be recognized as it is now.  There are numerous reasons why the film was labled as the best picture.  First of all, it made 1 billion dollars world-wide, and that's the record for any films.  The reason?  Leonardo Dicaprio's in the movie and if you are a girl and doesn't like Leonardo DiCaprio, you are not normal.  I know several girls who saw Titanic about 20 times.  Also, the movie was in fact, entertaining, I must admit.  I enjoyed it.  The sound and the score by James Horner and the cinematography was excellent.  Also, the year was a weak year for films.  L. A Confidential or Good Will Hunting or As Good as It Gets were good, but not terrific, but they were better than Titanic.  Titanic was a blockbuster, but the screenplay sucked.  The screenplay sucked like hell.  The plot was simple, a poor, living-on-the-wild-side boy meets a rich girl who is controlled by her mother and falls in love.  It is the most simplest plot ever!  Even a five-year-old can think of that!  But the excellent direction of James Cameron actually overcame the screenplay and made it entertaining so James Cameron deserved an Oscar for best director.  But the fact of the matter is, even with all the technical excellence, the foundation and the backbone of all films except for action films, the screenplay SUCKED!  Remember the line, ""Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! ""?  Is that the best Cameron can think of?  Films such as L. A Confidential and Good Will Hunting or As Good as it Gets had better screenplays and better cast of actors then Titanic.

Mixing the fictional story of Rose and Jack, with the true life people who really sailed on the Titanic was done quite well.  I can tell you, watching the very detailed sinking of the ship probably only gave the viewers a 20% feeling of horror that the actual passengers had, especially third class. How they put people in the ships by class really irritated me, a sad fact but true.  Putting only 12 people in a boat that could have held 60-70 when they were already short of lifeboats was incomprehensible.

Look at the female characters in Terminator or Aliens they are so butch and testosterone fuelled they aught to have beards and scratch their hairy testicles while chewing tobacco. I mean look what he did to our lovely English rose Kate Winslit in this ship wreck of a movie. He has this alleged Edwardian Lady stick her middle finger up at David Warner at one point and then slugs unconscious some burly crewman who was getting in her way. To top it all she has sex with a total stranger from steerage. Please!! With his tin ear for dialogue he should have stuck to doing thick ear action movies rather than this overly ripe disaster movie. There's an amateurish attempt to demonstrate the stupidity of Ruth's mother having her dismiss some sketches of Picasso (How did they get on board) with the words that he would never amount to anything. Subtle this is not. It looks far better than it sounds which is a great pity as some of the visuals are rather good. One unexpected laugh happened when Cameron picked up his Oscar he screams a line from the film ""I'm the king of the world"". Of course it fell completely flat on the assembled audience, who had never seen this dire movie or had forgotten the execrable script.

This COULD of been a film of immense glory and scope, whisking us away on a beautiful journey, showing us humanity's undying spirit in the face of ultimate disaster.  Instead, James Cameron tries to replay ""Gone With The Wind"" on a ship.  His efforts could have turned it all into a success if the characters weren't about as interesting as cardboard, and if the story was written by someone who didn't flunk 7th grade english.  The on-screen chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet was laughable at best.  I didn't believe for one second that they even LIKED each other, much less LOVE each other (they were both victims of an over-powering score by James Horner). They just didn't even look right for each other.  Maybe they should have ""beefed-up"" DiCaprio so that he actually weighed over 100 pounds, or just found a different actor all together.  I just want to know what happened to the Leonardo DiCaprio from ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", or ""Basketball Diaries"".  While watching this film, I was wondering if Cameron was holding up cue cards behind the camera by the way he acted.

7 December 2013,amastarwars,7," I love and hate this movie
","What can you say about Titanic not yet said by another person, or named in another review?. Titanic is, without a doubt, a strong film, a compelling story, a attracting one. I myself have a big love/hate relationship with this movie. In 1997, when it was released, and cynical 90's where at it's highest, I knew this movie was not going to be for me, I knew which was going to be my reaction to this film. We all knew James Cameron, he made ""The Terminator"" in 1984, Aliens in 1986, and ""Terminator 2"" in 1991, all of them decent (not great) action flicks, with one common denominator, LOTS OF MONEY. And that is James Cameron about, he spends and earns tons of money, because (Regardless of your love or your hate for him) he makes the right choices. Avatar sucked, just putting it out there. But what was that worked so much about Titanic?. We might say that Leo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet, or the huge budget of which we where all informed of. I want to think that it was the Leo-Mania, of women that time, after Romeo+Juliet and ""Who's eating Gilbert Grape"", or the fact that it got unbelievable amount of money for it advertising, or the good visual effects, or the Oscar swept, or the lazy, easy to entertain story, or the bland characters, which everybody could be identified with, cause it's easy to identify with so general personalities. I wanna believe that, but it is not true in a whole. Well, it's true in part, but the greatest factor of the success of this film, was truly it 's quality. Not it's story, nor it's characters, those where clichéd and bland (But entertaining, it was an entertaining story told a million times, not like ""Avatar"", a lousy story told a million times). The fact that Rose and Jack know each other for about two days and decide to risk their lives for each other is pretty distracting, but, what the hell, Disney did that to us in all of it's movies. So, why 7 stars if I think all this crap about this movie? Because this movie is great, really great, I don't want it to be, but just look at it, it's so big, it's so fancy, the costume, the production, the visual effects, the amazing cinematography, the pacing, everything was correct, and makes you feel this three hours film like a two hours film, you want more, and not because it let you expecting more, just because it was amazing, and you want to see that again. So, to sum up. I don't see this as a great story, and I don't believe characters where great, but technically it was one of the most complete movies ever released. Look at the Oscars it won. Best Picture, Best director,Best editing, Best Cinematography, Best sound, Best sound effects, Best costume design, Best art direction, Best Visual effects, Best song and best score. And I agree with all of them, I think it is amazing visually and has a great score, even if I hate ""My heart will go on"" (Maybe it was Celine's Dion fault), and acting wasn't awful neither, regardless of the blandness of the characters, Kate Winslet was very good, Billy Zane was a nice over the top villain, and Leo DiCaprio was Okey (Just okay). So, I really like this movie, I can watch it over and over, even do it's not at all perfect, or it has way more cons than pros, it's hypnotizing, its easy to watch, it was made with a lot of effort and it shows, it's full atmosphere, full visual, and a relaxing story and characters.

If they hadn't had the whole love story plot, this movie wouldnt suck. The action/adventure of this movie is actually quite fun, but the whole rich girl meets poor boy love was thrown in there to attract some audience.

The love story leading us all through it is hokey and it's far too long, but it is captivating. Winslet was decent, Leo was marginal, and Zane was way over the top - could any real person actually be that annoying? The effects were mostly good and occasionally stunning. Overall, it wasn't a bad flick. Had Cameron put half the effort into the romance story and the characters that he put into the effects it might have earned it's 11 Oscars. On the other hand, you have to hand it to him for being smart enough to know that there are millions of women out there that'll drag their boyfriends and husbands out over and over to see the charming and handsome DiCaprio drown for the love of a woman (and husbands and boyfriends that are secretly not complaining about having another look at Winslet or the cool FX).",/review/rw0437501/?ref_=tt_urv

Keep in mind there is terrific acting, excellent use of CGI and effects and some very suspenseful scenes not to mention the grueling emotions throughout the movie. Titanic created and extorted many famous memorable scenes to be remembered dearly in the future of the movie business. James Cameron directs a fine romantic movie, that was executed fantastically.

13 October 2012,Hotwok2013,," This Is Not A Wet Blanket.
","One harsh film critic memorably called this film, in his opinion, ""A wet blanket"". In my personal opinion James Cameron's ""Titanic"" at the very least borders on a great film. A great love story is intertwined into the tragedy of this longish, but never boring, film. All in all it is not only an excellently entertaining film but probably both Kate Winslet & Leonardo DeCaprio's finest hour. Whether or not a rich high-society woman would be capable of falling in love with a poor steerage passenger, (who won the money to buy his ticket playing poker), in real life is debatable, but I was able to suspend my disbelief. Leonardo DeCaprio plays a young man called Jack Dawson who is an aspiring artist & is excellent. Although from a working-class background he is worldly-wise & has been around. He meets Rose DeWitt (Kate Winslet) after he saves her life when she attempts to commit suicide. She is intended (mainly at her mother's insistence) to marry a man named Cal Hockley played by Billy Zane. Rose doesn't really love him & things have started to get on top of her. Mr. Hockley is rich but such an upper-class scumbag that you cannot really blame Rose for contemplating topping herself!. The courtship on board the ship between Rose & Jack is great & often done to the haunting theme music in the background which adds to the romance. The cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely beautiful & is probably the single best factor of the entire movie. The filming of the ship striking an iceberg & eventually sinking is particularly well done. My final comment concerns the closing credits as Celine Dion sings ""My Heart Will Go On"". Everybody, it seems, from the films smallest bit-player extras down to Mr. Cameron's tea lady gets a mention in the credits which really do go on & on & on! The number of people listed, but not credited, in the cast list is utterly astounding & I couldn't help wondering what, (if anything?), they were paid.",/review/rw2688051/?ref_=tt_urv
21 May 2014,zdh952,8," Holds up, but has problems
","I just watched this for the first time in about 15 years last night. I saw it when it came out, and i was entirely too young to appreciate it (i was about 9 when it came out). The movie over all holds up and it good but there are few things i don't care for. Visually, even 17 years later, the movie is a masterpiece. Sets, costume, cgi, all of it is a impressive as it was when it first came out. The first half of the movie is slow and plodding, which everyone complains about, but this is a love story, not a disaster movie, so I personally think those people need to readjust their expectations and watch this again. My big problem is the 2 leads. DiCaprio and Winslet are OK. But thats honestly about it. Lines are delivered (I feel) either flatly or are over acted. I see them falling in love and honestly it doesn't grab me. And that's not because I'm a guy, I love a good romance. Something about their chemistry just doesn't seem as genuine as i was expecting. Some of the lines at the end are painfully corny, especially DiCaprio's telling Winslet that she is going to ""make lots of babies"".... Seriously? That could have been beautiful, it's the gut wrenching end to a Romeo and Juliet love story, but I feel like that whole scene was written by an 8 year old. Kathy Bates, as always, I liked, and Billy Zane gets my vote for ""Best Scumbag in a Movie Ever"". I do like that Cameron make Winslet ""Transform"" as so many of his characters do (Sarah Connor and Ripley start out powerless and end up tearing the movie apart, and in much the same way Winslet starts as a trapped helpless woman, and ends the movie by taking an ax to doors and saving the lead male). That is done VERY well. I'm still giving this 8 stars because even though this may have snags that I don/t care for, the over all story and the setting are very very strong. The pathos of the passengers drowning or trying to save their children had a knot in my stomach and most of the characters are great, even if the 2 leads are only good.",/review/rw3020050/?ref_=tt_urv

","Many love stories have the same plot. They are predictable and boring, and by the end of the film viewers are done watching the couple kiss and be cutesy. However, The Titanic ties in not only a love story, but an adventure, an intense inner battle, and a mortifying loss. From the beginning of the film, viewers are attached to Jack Dawson, feeling like they want him to succeed. So when they see how how happy Jack is that he won a ticket on the RMS Titanic, viewers want nothing more for the poor and extremely attractive boy to be happy. Jack and Rose have a love that is almost sickening, but the affection they show each other makes viewers want to experience a crazy love story of their own. It is nice to see a rich girl let her guard down and be herself around Jack, something that is lost in the craziness of every day life, and the fact that it is human nature to try and impress people we like. When watching the Titanic everyone (I hope) knew what would happen at the end, but it was heartbreaking to see Rose's lover's life come to an end. Honestly, I think they both could have fit on the old door when they were waiting to be rescued, but there had to be a heartbreaking tragedy that leaves one crying on the couch wanting to dive into the ocean to bring Jack Dawson back to life. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are phenomenal actors, and they have amazing chemistry together on and off screen.",/review/rw3096313/?ref_=tt_urv

","""Titanic"" is one great film that never falters in length, talent or action but is not ever to be considered THE #1 film of the '90s. It may come as ONLY a close second behind ""Schindler's List"". Kate Winslet is a promising character actress but Leo DiCaprio is destined to play only contemporary parts well. His take on Romeo in ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"" (1996) was very 90s despite the faithfulness to Will's original script and Jack in ""Titanic"" was very much the same. ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was pretty much of a flop on his part also. Billy Zane, after playing dozens of supporting parts now has a chance of proving himself a good leading man (such as shown in tv's ""Cleopatra"" as Mark Antony last May). Gloria Stewart made a tremendous comeback after 45+ years with her portrayal of Old Rose but millions were shocked when she didn't win the Supporting Actress Oscar. Who did it go to? Miss Kim Basinger! Notorious for playing a prostitute in every movie she's made. Kathy Bates is a perfect choice to play the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown and Frances Fisher is a narrow-minded wretch of a woman as Rose's mother Ruth, one who only cared about herself and her position in society. Now for sheer spectacle and brilliant music, action and tension, ""Titanic"" may qualify as the best ACTION movie of the decade but not on a general ""all-in-all"" scale as a unique drama. ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) finally met it's match as the Oscar-winning champ when ""Titanic"" tied with it as the film with the highest number of Oscars (11 in all for both).

4 March 2002,amantsdupontneuf,9," classic hollywood epic
","this is a very good old fashioned hollywood epic. the two leads ~~ leonardo decaprio and kate winslet are ideally cast. their performances are good but not their best work on film. the two of them however do have wonderful screen chemistry which is essential to this film, because at it's heart ""titanic"" is a beautiful love story. the final hour of the film detailing the sinking of the ship and fate of the passengers is heartwrenching. the special effects are superb, but this is not at all what impressed me about this movie. films overdone with special effects today are plentiful. it's usually a sign that a good story is lacking. ""titanic"" has a good story though, in spite of what several people have said in their comments. it's not a masterful screenplay, but it can stand up well next to most of the great epics in film history. i don't think that james cameron was trying to duplicate orson welles here. this is a very entertaining film and it is really sad to see that so many people have rated it so lowly. more than 5000 people have given ""titanic"" a rating of ""1"" on this website. i refuse to beleive that most of those people actually think this film is that bad. a vote of ""1"" would mean that you can find absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie whatsoever. if ""titanic is ""complete garbage"" as some folks have said.... i'd be curious to see what other movies you have given the lowest rating to. as for myself, i didn't give ""titanic"" the highest rating of ""10."" i gave it a ""9."" it is a throw back to the kind of films that we rarely see come out of hollywood anymore. also... la confidential was not robbed at the oscars. i liked la confidential. i thought it was a real good movie. alot of people though, who have never seen a movie before 1990 might be overrating it a bit. there are several film noirs from the past that are more cleverly written than la confidential. besides, the people who are voting for the oscars are not some genius film students. they're no more intelligent than the average joe. so if you're gonna say that la confidential got robbed by losing to titanic, then you should realize that about 700 other pictures and actors over the last 75 years have probably been robbed as well.it's nothing new. prefering one film over another is a matter of personal opinion, and more academy members voted for titanic. this is not the world's greatest injustice, you guys. anyway.... anyone with half a brain knows that it was ""the ice storm"" in 1997 that got robbed, not ""la confidential.""",/review/rw0436462/?ref_=tt_urv

Why did the movie win so many Oscars? It was the lack of quality movies that year. There are many reasons Titanic didnt make the Top 250 among the voters.

This is a fascinating movie: it's dramatic, gripping, emotional, sometimes exciting, the acting is also good, the music is marvelous. One of the best movies ever made!

","I'll admit it if I want to or not... Titanic was a decent movie overall, and on the surface its worthy of a five rating. However, once you calculate for bad acting performances, the worst script/lines from a 1998 Oscar nominated movie, and the shadowy feeling of the overbearing, heavy hand of Cameron and his action film special effects- you get a three. Furthermore, because of the media-hype, because of young girls, and because the Academy is a sucker for epic, classic movies, the real Best Picture of 1998, Good Will Hunting, was lost in the swell. I mean come on... you're going to tell me that there is a scene between Leonardo and Kate that is half as powerful as any between Matt and Driver? Let me just remind you of a scene between Robin and Matt- Robin confronts Matt's character with pictures of his body badly bruised by the abuse he suffered from his father. Matt says something like 'this is B.S.- this is not important,' to which Robin keeps repeating ""Its ok, its ok..."" Eventually Matt falls weeping into Robin's arms- now that scene was powerful, moving, and let's not forget cheap. Basically, Titanic won movie of the year because it was pretty-looking, nice and shiny, and was terribly expensive. What a waste when compared to Good Will Hunting...",/review/rw0437257/?ref_=tt_urv

The thought that this event actually did happen was also something that makes it even more amazing. James Cameron is a genius! He has totally captured the whole event in a way that so many people have related to. For people to say that this movie is no good is to say that they weren't watching it! The way James Cameron has included Jack and Rose with actual people who were on the Titanic is very well done and the fact that they used such a fantastic cast and movie set only adds to the reasons why this movie will always be regarded as a classic.

He didn't even mention any of the people who died.  He might as well of called the film Jack & Rose.  because the only thing related to the actual true story was the ship they were on and the sinking at the end.  James Camerons other films were great, but for this one he should be locked up.

The former uses great special effects to tell the story of one of the biggest disasters of the 20th century, whereas the latter is filled with trashy one-liners which the scriptwriters deem ""romantic"", but are in fact endless cliches which have been heard before in other love films. The lead characters are annoying. Leo is completely fake in his portrayal of a ""poor"" person. It completely ruins the character's personality, as you, the viewer, in fact know that he is getting half a million quid for doing this, and is about as poor as a multi-billionaire. Kate Winslet is infuriating as Rose, an upper class girl turned into a scruff by the ""wayward"" Jack, but is amusing to see how out of place her snobbish accent is at the slobbish 3rd class party.

In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the sad and beautiful love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely provocative and tearful.

Ok, the plot isn't original and it is a bit stereotyped( the old story of a poor guy who falls in love with an aristocratic girl ) , DiCaprio was really better inspired in Romeo+Juliet than in this film and , of course , Titanic is NOT the greatest movie ever appeared but , however , it deserves to be seen without prejudices(at least to enjoy all the marvellous digital effects).",/review/rw0437278/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I came to watch this film, I was expecting to find the next Casablanca, by the reviews in the media and of people I knew who had seen this movie. Instead, I saw another Independence day, a movie with all the special effects, but a weak and cliched plot. Indeed, some parts of the movie can be quite entertaining.  Several classic rushing water scenes in the second half of the movie, rival that of even The Poseidon Adventure.  The sinking of the ship was shown with great accuracy and remarkable effect.     However, I have never seen a ""Best Picture"" film with as weak a storyline as this.  The second half of the movie contains chase scenes and water scenes, that although entertaining, has no relevance to the plot, and shows that indeed this movie cannot be considered a classic ""film"".  Take those special effects scenes away, and you have a story that is a poor rendition of Romeo and Juliet, and the actors are quite horrible.  yes, i am a guy, but i do believe that di caprio has good acting qualities, as shown in Basketball diaries, and What's eating Gilbert Grape.  In this movie, however, he does a pretty pitiful job as Jack.  Kate Winslet does not do much better and does a pitiful job of overacting.  This movie did not deserve 11 Academy Awards, and all its nominations.  Take into account other movies which won ""Best Picture"", even the ones in the 90s (Braveheart, Forrest Gump, Dances with Wolves), and one can clearly see that the Academy was clearly swayed by the  masses of people who watched it.  Just remember, that the amount of money a movie makes doesn't necessarily  determine how good it really is.

In fact, halfway through the movie I heard another attendee say, quite loudly, ""Just sink the damned ship"". His words reflected my sentiments. What could have been an exciting, tense historical drama turned out to be a sappy and overly sentimental love story meant to tug at your heart strings -- the new-found lover and rescuer of a trapped-in-arranged-marriage- woman -- tragically lost at sea. Cameron, whose interest in the sinking of the actual ship is legendary, is a good film director, but he sacrificed his love of the ship on the altar of cliched Hollywood storytelling.

Leo really didn't give alot to the movie but his presence did not detract, just the same as Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves, he was just as wooden but for some strange reason he got nominated, he had about 1 and perhaps 2 different facial expressions but the movie soured as a masterpiece anyway. Titanic is one of the best theatre experiences, I never actually did see at the theatre but I saw twice on video, it is easy to imagine it, movies always are 100 times better on the big screen. Its becoming more and more rare now that people go with the crowd for the sake of it but occasionally we should try not to be so opinionated that we dont listen to anyone else.

Something must be wrong with the rating system - not the movie. Many critics seem to concentrate their scorn on the love story between Rose and Jack while others expressed boredom with the special effects and other elements associated with the actual sinking of the ship. To them, I can only say that they must belong to the school satirized by John Candy on the old SCTV series who could only get enthusiastic about something when he got to blow it up, ""real good!"". No, sadly I'm afraid nobody gets blown up; but there is plenty of drama and tension as we await, not the fate of the ship, but of the passengers and of course, the lovers. Cameron has proven himself capable of balancing an intimate love story with an epic event while keeping everything in perspective. If nothing else the movie represents an incredible logistical achievement, and a special effects tour de force!

If Hollywood only made the same historical/factual/documentary type movies, that could get boring.  So, hollywood likes to spice things up a bit.  Sure the romance between Jack and Rose MAY have been unrealistic, but that doesn't mean it could NEVER have happened!  I've seen stranger things believe it or not.  Plus, we have to remember, that NO historical movie (not even the ""good ones"") are 100% factually accurate.  Sure, some are more accurate than others, but that's not necessarily the case in MOST movies.  Most movies add more drama or romantic stories in them to make things more interesting.

Chris O'Donnell or Josh Lucas would've been a bit closer to the mark here. As far as the Rose character, wonderfully portrayed by Kate Winslet, it didn't take a lot of time to see the possible real person she was based on. Her mannerisms and defiance of custom seemed to emulate the late Alice Roosevelt Longworth (1884-1980), daughter of Theodore Roosevelt. As I watched Kate, I began to see Alice, literally! If you don't know much about Alice and her later impact on Washington DC politics and mores, there are several great bios available.

Also the great stories by the ever so hated Jack who was played perfectly by Leonardo DiCaprio who has become a icon playing parts such as The Aviator and The Departed. Also we cannot forget about Rose DeWitt Bukater his love played by Kate Winslet. These to had perfect chemistry throughout the entire movie and made it as sad as it was to become.

The work they put into this movie is incredible, just about all details concearning the ""unskinkable"" ship herself was flawless. Only this year have they matched the Special Effects. The Directing was awesome, couldn't of been better, But what really stands out in my mind was the Score. The music fit the movie so well, It caused the viewer to really expierence the feelings of tragedy, love, excitment, suspence, grace and pain all in one. It wasn't just threw into the movie, it described the essence of the film, and made the movie seem that much more real. The Ending was very tragic, and yet very exciting at the same time. The entire moive was just incredibly moving. Even Leonardo DeCaprio, who i've never been impressed by, pulled of a surprisinly well done acting ability. Kate winslet really made the movie though. I would recomend this movie to anyone who appreciates great detail and tragical drama, even those action lovers (like myself). But this movie isn't to be taking lightly, It's a journey to the past, a chance to expierience history as it was, and does an incredible job at it.

29 March 2006,imflyingjack415,10," Beginning with a treasure hunt, ending with a heartbreak...
","Titanic has been known as one of the biggest movies of all time, and is definitely a classic. From the time when you see the famous shipwreck, to the very end, you will just stare at the screen in awe. This is my opinion of the movie, and I know that probably many people would disagree with me. What more could you ask for in a movie? Suspense, romance, some comedy between the conversations of Jack and Rose, drama, almost every genre fits it. When you first see the drawing of young Rose that is found in the safe of the wreck, you are confused as to what it might be, but find it beautiful just the same. Hearing that old Rose is almost 101, you might find it hard to be realistic, but by the end of the movie when Jack is making Rose promise to go on with her life without him, you believe anything this movie has to throw at you. When Rose Calvert begins her story, you are shown a young woman who is sick of her first class life, and wants to ""break free"" from her chains. A man named Jack Dawson is also shown playing a poker game, and attempting to win the third class tickets that were bet on the ""ship of dreams."" Of course, Rose and Jack meet and there is an instant connection, and half way through the movie, you want nothing more than both of them falling in love. After taking Rose ""flying"" out of her caged life, Rose and Jack do fall in love, even thought they've known each other for only a matter of days. While all of this is happening, you forget all about the dreadful iceberg that will eventually separate Jack and Rose physically for good. Just when you get attached to their story, the ship soon begins to sink. After watching both characters almost lose their lives in more than one way, you eventually witness Jack giving up the one space on the floating board so that Rose can live in place of him. A tear-jerker every single time you watch, the music alone will just make you start to tear up. Though the tragedy was unbelievably depressing, and leaves you with a heavy heart for days afterward, this wonderful record-breaking Oscar winning movie will have your heart. Now, almost 9 years since the movie came out, I still love it, and I know that it is a movie that I and many others will never tire of, for Titanic is one of the best films of all time!",/review/rw1328417/?ref_=tt_urv

Why do so many hate this movie and are ready to swear that it is one of the worst ever made? Perhaps they should expose their eyes to everyday movies more often if they speak thus. Let us examine the movie. The acting, while not all that brilliant, is sufficient for the parts to come through honestly enough. The dialogue, while not the greatest or deepest is appropriate and, let's face it, in view of what comes out now a days, quite descent. The length of the movie may be long but is, I feel, necessary and the movie does hold attention with ought becoming a bore. The special effects are, no one can dispute, magnificent, and the costumes realistic. So what is so incredibly bad about this movie? It is alright. It is, in fact, better then alright. It is a rather darn good movie about love with a historical background. The biggest weakness of this movie is that rather then being viewed as pretty dang good, it was rather viewed as the best thing ever created by man or god.

The acting is all good, the plot is good (though predictable- as Titanic should be), the dialogue is passable and everything else fits into place. What are we left with? Dialogue. There aren't any iconic lines (barring the cheese-filled ""I'm the king of the world..."") or any lines with exceeding power or wit, as there frequently are in typical classic films. Alas, this movie goes beyond that. The ""my heart will go on"" melody played throughout the film is touching, to say the least, despite my untoward attitude of the Celine Dion version of the song. The two main characters come together in such a way typical of any romance movie. Jack and Rose etc and etc until they etc and then the ship sinks. Good.

It's not supposed to be realistic - it shows a blown up, exaggerated version of reality to capture our imagination and our hearts. And it succeeds impressively. Leonardo DiCaprio is good, but not his best (watch The Departed or Wolf of Wall Street for Leo's acting abilities). Kate Winslet was probably slightly better. But the magic about Titanic is the story and the directing. From the beginning, the characters captivate you. They are not superficial - in contrary, they have flaws and advantages, just like everyone else. The movie is long but the pace is not slow. Every scene is necessary and Cameron does a great job in making us want this couple to make it. I don't need to mention that the music is exceptional, complimenting the atmosphere perfectly. The effects are good and very realistic (it shows that Cameron actually visited the Titanic before filming). Most of all, it is apparent that this movie is an epic. I definitely consider it as one of the best love stories of recent time. It is a little cliché and a little soppy, but I promise you won't regret watching it. So ignore the haters and go and enjoy it for what it is: a romantic drama with amazing characters, music, directing and background. Even if you hate it, at least you'll be able to laugh about it with your friends!",/review/rw2981312/?ref_=tt_urv

Have the feeling he knows his critics can't wait to tear him down? And by the way, I agree the love story is relatively weak.

7 November 2005,montysmith-slp,4," Definition of hubris: ""King of the world!""
","The sinking of the Titanic is an enduring story of 20th-century man's arrogance in an age of speed and comfort. The maiden voyage of the world's largest, most luxurious ship had a grim date with destiny on the night of April 14th 1912. There have been many more catastrophic disasters since but few with the haunting resonance of the Titanic's tragic fate. For complex social and political reasons, the story of the Titanic is a shared experience of human folly and heroism. James Cameron's hyped up extravaganza chooses to ignore the significance of the event, opting simply to tell a trite love story that ends in the water. It is in no way a fitting memorial to the 1537 souls lost at sea in the early hours of April 15th. Worse, it is a travesty. The American ship Californian was less than 10 miles away yet ignored the Titanic's distress flares. This integral component in the unfolding disaster is not merely skimped by Cameron, it is totally ignored. Why? By focusing solely on the insipid Romeo and Juliet romance between Leonardi DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, Cameron diminishes the tragedy's devastating scale. ""Size matters,"" claims Cameron, missing the point  he merely replicates the hubris of Edwardian thinking on the 'unsinkable' ship. His sense of size relates only to his huge sets and the amount of screen time allotted to his twittering lovebirds. Cameron has made a Titanic for the dumbed-down MTV generation. His bloated romance lacks the humility and simple grace of the moving British film on the same subject, A Night To Remember. Titanic is more like another 1958 film, An Affair To Remember  soggy, ponderous and clichéd to the core: the steerage passengers are salt-of-the-earth types happily dancing drunkenly to Irish reels; the aristocrats are pompous, stuffed-shirt repressives; the crew is a collection of doughty Brit caricatures. Even so, most of them are more interesting than the limpid lovers sketched by DiCaprio and Winslet. He quotes Bob Dylan lyrics. She flips the finger to David Warner. In 1912. But the film's failure as drama rests not with them. The director falters from the outset, airlifting an improbably sprightly 102-year-old survivor on to an Atlantic salvage ship. And history isn't big enough for Cameron  in a laughably melodramatic lapse he has Billy Zane chasing the loving couple through the flooding ship, firing off shots. As for the heralded special effects, they are not always convincing and, in one awful crane shot swooping from bow to stern, clearly the work of computer imagery. James Cameron, the writer-director behind such soulless Hollywood product as Terminator 2 and True Lies, was never going to be the right man to tell the great story of the Titanic.",/review/rw1211261/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are few films that elicit in me such passionate loathing as this piece of utter rubbish. This is lacking in practically everything that ought to be in a movie. No aliens, no graphic scenes of cannibalism, no serial killers, monsters spawned by nuclear power, special effects obviously made from random objects found in the director's office, or surrealistic body horror. Also, no werewolves. I suppose the title should have given me a warning, it doesn't contain the phrases ""blood"", ""invasion of the"", ""cannibal"", ""walks among us"", ""massacre"", "" meets Frankenstein"", or ""from outer space""; all of which are generally good indicators of quality cinema. It's also filmed in this weird artificial style, which I hate. Mainstream cinema fans might like this style, I prefer my films to look like they were made in someone's garage back in the 70s. And then there's that awful theme song. If you want a good movie theme song, listen to Surfing Dead by The Cramps, the theme from Return Of The Living Dead; by one of the finest bands in history.

Just watch The Astro-zombies instead; now that's a good movie. Cameron has sunk far from his days doing special effects on Galaxy Of Terror (his best work by far.

","After rave reviews and incredible marketing I still could've cared less to see this film.  Then a friend brought it over to watch.  So I did.  It was just what I expected. The big wigs pumped this balloon full of hot air.  The basic storyline reminds me of Shakespeare's classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" - a story of two incredibly stupid and starry-eyed kids which could only end in disaster. Unfortunately it isn't as well written. Money, timing and power fed this puppy through the mainstream American gut. However I couldn't stomach the silly writing and over-the-top special effects.  And then there's always the question of why they gave it a PG13 rating with the slow camera paneling across the naked female anatomy. The character's backgrounds seem highly contrived (a gambler who just happened to win a ticket to sail across the ocean and a young well-to-do girl trapped in engagement for money?) Then there's the matter of the ""suicide"" meeting where Jack tries to talk her out of jumping ship with tactics which would impress even Freud . . . if such tactics would ever actually work.  Well Rose and Jack make a lovely couple of crazy kids with their wild days of drinking below decks, standing on tiptoes, nude art sessions and making out in the backseat of a car - honestly, who put this stuff in a script?  I didn't know whether to laugh or walk away and find better use of my afternoon. As if this weren't enough bull to swallow, they add the whole search for the jewel.  Then, at the end, the old Rose drops it in the water.  She could have done that years before.  Was it some obvious imagery that totally missed me or did anyone else think she was whacked? Now we come to the best part - ""special"" effects.  And this cookie was loaded with them.  The water slosh was great.  But seeing the ship sink was a big disappointment.  Rather than using a tasteful display of the ocean liner in the murky black of night, Titanic brightens up the entire ocean better than the stadium lighting.  In fact it's brilliant enough for us to see the passengers fall like ping-pongs off the deck.  I think they should've used less CG wizardry and more brain power to sink the boat. Not all of Titanic was bad though.  In fact I loved it when Billy Zane's character slaps the silly girl around - it was one of his best performances.

","from reading most of the comments on this site about this movie, most of them seem to be against it.  Most everyone that wrote a comment said that this movie sucks.  I also notice that most of the comments are written by guys.  Being a guy myself, I am going to have to disagree with everyone and say that this was a great movie, and say that it deserves everything that it got.  I'm not saying that it's the best movie ever made, but I am saying, that you can't deny the attention to detail in this movie.  Everything about what went on when the ship was going down was absolutely on key.  The whole time, I felt as though I was going down with the ship.  The problem I think people have with this movie, mainly the guys, is that every girl in america went nuts for Leonardo.  All I seem to hear when people trash the movie is how much they hated him.  I think that picking Leo as the lead was genius. I mean think about, your making a love story, so why not pick the one guy that all girls are crazy about already?  I think the director took advantage in a lot of points.  I mean lets face it, when you're making a movie like this, you're not going for the artsiest approach or going for originallity, your going for what's going to attract the biggest audience.  At the time, there was already some hype about the titanic with the reunion of some of it's survivors.  The movie couldn't have come out at a better time.  Plus, what other kind of movie is going to attract the sort of people that are going to go see it over and over and over?  A love story!  The characters and storyline couldn't have been any more conveniently picked to make a movie that people are going to go nuts over.  I just think that a lot of people were largly disappointed when they found out that this highly anticipated epic movie turned out to be a love story.  Which in my opinion, is the one of the best love stories ever told.  With one flaw, which lies in the age of the lovers, which makes it hard for me to believe that they could really know anything about true love.  But still excellently executed. Nonetheless, I think that this was an excellent film with an excellently picked cast.  It couldn't have been done better.  And a lot of you out there are probably thinking, man, this guy's gay.

Although it was my favourite movie for a long time but isn't anymore, it is still the only movie I've ever seen that has the ability to reduce me to tears every time. The music is beautiful and haunting - and possibly one of the best things about the movie - but the acting and romance is equally good. OK, so not ALL the acting is good but I definitely think Leonardo was the best actor. Kate was just as good - if you can set aside her dodgy American accent! Maybe the plot is predictable and cliched but there is just something special about this movie - and I'm sure many others will agree as well. There is a great chemistry between the two main leads and they are lovely to watch as their characters fall in love with each other. Billy Zane plays a convincing villain (though I'm not sure about his scary hairline!), and Frances Fisher is quite good as Rose's mother. However, one of my favourite characters was Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) and I found it very sad when **SPOILER!!!** he says goodbye to Rose and you realise he's going to stay and go down with the ship. I found the ending heartbreaking and it took me a few days to stop thinking about it! I know there are many mistakes and historical inaccuracies but at the end of the day it was intended to be a romance first and foremost, and then a drama and an action movie. I have nothing against those who prefer A Night To Remember - and I know it's a lot more accurate - but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives in this movie. And as far as the mistakes go, any epic containing special effects is bound to have mistakes, and if you can move past the odd continuity shot and sun setting on the wrong side of the ship, you can appreciate the movie for what it is - a touching love story that does what it's supposed to do. 8/10",/review/rw0437597/?ref_=tt_urv

","Technically flawless, Titanic is a movie without soul. Not one single shot is intended to draw the audience in and make viewers want to continue to watch. We know that expansive, historically accurate movies that use fiction and an unusually long amount of time to make their point can work--The Godfather, Godfather Part II, and Gone With the Wind, among them. We also know that historically accurate movies that use fiction don't have to be unusually long to work--From Here to Eternity and Reversal of Fortune, among them. Unfortunately, James Cameron and his backers learned nothing from these examples. Instead, they have shown us that it is possible to be extremely successful financially with a movie that is without soul or purpose. As I watched this lethargic, painfully over-designed product (it's not really a movie or a ""film""), I was reminded of movies like Top Hat, Bringing Up Baby, the Grapes of Wrath, and Rebecca. These wondrous offerings and many other of the most entertaining and memorable movies are freed from such concerns as historically accurate sets, costumes, and props by relying on the obvious talents of their performers and crews. For every ""period"" picture that cannot match the perfection of its design with laudable acting, writing, and directing (Ever see the Bostonians or the Great Gatsby?), there are (thankfully) a good number of ""period"" pictures that surmount any shortcomings in design accuracy with otherwise skillful storytelling and acting. I really wanted to believe that Titanic could break through the barrier of a recreated ship with an interesting and entertaining story.

","When I entered the theater to see the film Titanic, I expected to see a romantic epic reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago, or even The English Patient. Unfortunately, all I saw was a $200 million film about social inequality a la Romeo and Juliet.  The plot was so thin and the characters so underdeveloped that one longs for the ship to hurry up and sink within the first hour and a half.  The boat itself was not even that amazing.  Although the sinking scene was semi-exciting, it got old seeing the two characters run through hallways, only to be met by a door.  About half an hour could have been trimmed from the film by removing these ridiculous scenes alone. It still amazes me that this film received so much recognition, not to mention the amount of money it took in at the box office.  The only explanation I can offer is that apparently twelve-year-old girls have nothing better to do with their time and money than ogle at the mediocre acting abilities of the girlish Leonardo DiCaprio.  The true atrocity of this film is not merely how mediocre it is, but the fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar when such films as The Sweet Hereafter and L.A. Confidential truly deserved it.

There was one character I did not like and that was Cal (Rose's Fiance), but Billy Zane played the character well and he fit the image that I would have of that kind of man. I liked how the movie showed the wreck of the Titanic after all those years and then Rose came into the part and started telling the story. If it would have went straight into the story I don't think that it would have been as good. It sort of gave the movie a little twist. The detail was good. There was a few places were you could tell that the ship was computer animated, and the part with the dolphins you could tell it was not real. Overall the movie was great and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.",/review/rw0437062/?ref_=tt_urv

2 June 2020,krational,9," Kal
","The night is as deep as the sea. I lie quietly on the bed and look at the Titanic. I don't know how many times I watched it. It seems that this has become a habit when I need to cry.
This time, I was moved by a villain named Karl. It always seems to hit the spotlight on the protagonist, Jack and Rose's love is undoubtedly sullen, every time he hates Karl for disrupting selfishness, wasting the chance of escape again and again on jealousy and conspiracy. From his perspective, I think I saw something new and wrote it out to share with you.
The first time was at the beginning of the film, he walked into Rose's room and saw the paintings she had collected. There is no doubt that he does not understand or care about art. He is a thorough businessman, even at the last moment of the film he is still a businessman. I looked at him and said with a smile, Rose liked these paintings, what Picasso or the like. It seemed to be full of disdain and mockery, but there was a bit of bitterness mixed in that mockery. He couldn't get into her world, he couldn't understand her, or art. He went on to say that she had to bring these paintings every time she went out. For the first time, I felt that maybe he didn't love Rose not only because he needed a glamorous and young wife, but also love. Although this love was also full of a strong merchant atmosphere, it was because he was powerless to change and unconscious. Arrived. If he just asked her to make the vase around him, then he would not care about her preferences, would not labor to bring her paintings with every trip, and would not understand her habits so much, because he cared about her.
Then, looking down, they went into the upper class as usual until he saw Jack, who saved Rose, on the deck. I don't know if it's too much of my heart. After his false thanks, I clearly saw his watchful glance at Jack, then turned around and embraced Rose immediately. The look was complicated and cold. He probably understood what was going on. Out of an instinctive vigilance, he felt that this person was different from Rose, so he didn't care about the gentleman's demeanor and was about to leave Luo ribbon here. When the crew proposed to give Jack some compensation, he invited him to dinner in the first class. Personally, he thought it was a little trick of love. He wanted him to be ugly, and hoped Rose could find him good by comparing with this poor boy, and The essence of the businessman is also the most vivid, he can thank him without paying a penny. I can't compare which of these two reasons is more important. The emotional and monetary factors are complicated. This is Karl.
However, things in the world often go against expectations. The more he wants to attack him, the more he wants to separate them, but instead promotes their inseparable life and death.
Next came the third-class cabin party. I have to say that Rose really did a little over here. Whether it is a man full of possessiveness, he can't bear his fiancee to openly go in pairs with another person on the ship. In full view, she took his hand and turned happily, hugging, like a pair of lovers. He still maintained his gentlemanly style, waiting for her to come at night, thinking that she would explain to him well, but instead of waiting for him, he not only waited for him, but she drank tea casually the next day and said, ""I'm too tired ""At that moment, he couldn't help it, he saw no sign of regret. When I saw him overturn the table, I felt that he was no different from any young man in love, young and impulsive. There is no proper way to save his woman. But this time he didn't touch Rose, he let his anger lie on the table, and silently warned her not to mess up.
And at night, he came to her again and took out the famous heart of the ocean. He was not an apology person, but he seemed to persevere by her side. He put a precious gem on her neck, which was a silent apology and weight. He was a businessman, and his apology was calculated. He gave her the gem in advance, and he just wanted to restore her heart. But he really didn't understand her. He also doesn't understand love.
The next thing got farther and farther away from his expectations. When he saw the painting, he just wanted to tear it off! However, the essence of the businessman made him come up with a conspiracy. He always wanted to get the most profit for the smallest price. As a result, he succeeded and Rose returned to him. He sent her to the lifeboat, but she eventually discovered his conspiracy and chose to go to the poor boy. He was almost mad and asked the servant next to him to find her. He still wanted to take her. He went back and took the necklace and money. Can you say he was selfish? Still smart?
Seeing that she was on the deck again, she was waiting to get on the lifeboat. She was still closely following him, still wearing his clothes. He was really dizzy and immediately forced her to put on his coat, but forgot that Diamonds. She refused to enter the lifeboat because of the poor boy. He was willing to lie and coax her into the boat at this time. I was moved by him at this moment. When he smiled and comforted her that I had arranged it, I promised you to take Jack away too. I think he really loves Rose. The only purpose of his lies is to coax her into the boat. Of course he knows what it means to get on the boat. When the two men in Rose's life looked at her on the railing and smiled goodbye to her, what was the difference between the two men? Their only moment of unification was for her life, and their only common denominator was loving her.
Rose finally chose to jump the ship, and when he died with Jack, Carl's last chance to board the ship was in front of him, but he gave up. We often only see Rose give up the boarding opportunity a few times and choose to be with Jack, but we don't see Carl do the same thing. Rose gave up twice and Carl gave up twice. Rose is for Jack, Carl is for Rose. In the end, he was young and full of emotions. He was finally stunned by jealousy and shot the pair of lovers. If his essence is so selfish and so cruel, how can he be so crazy? He really wished he could die with Jack. The bullets ran out, but none of them hit him. The expression that he was holding a gun but couldn't make a bullet was really desperate, so he gave up. In the end he found that the diamond was still given to her. In such an ironic way, he laughed and laughed at the drama of the matter. Laughing he could not hold either one, his two babies.
I've been thinking about what Karl finally found among the survivors, whether it was Rose or Diamond. Rose had loved him crazily. He had done a lot of impulsive stupid things for her. Diamond was also what he always missed, representing the merchant's breath in his bones. He was right, those were his two babies, two babies that were lost forever.",/review/rw5793120/?ref_=tt_urv

","I didn't see Titanic until May 98 and really didn't expect to like it much but I was swept away by it; the only word I could use to describe it when people asked if I liked it was ""incredible"". I've now seen it 3 times and that's not the easiest thing to do when you've got a newborn baby!! 3 hour movies kind of cut it fine between feeds! But I managed because Titanic is a sublime film experience and I've never felt so touched by a movie; in fact 3 and a bit hours wasn't long enough and I hope there will be a director's cut because there is a fair bit of important historical facts and features omitted but I read they were left on the cutting-room floor. I'm no Leo fan and at first it seemed inappropriate casting him with Kate Winslet, who was wonderful as usual, but 2 viewings later it seemed right and I was into the love story side of it. Winslet and DiCaprio work well together and are believable if you can get past the notion that he looks 15 and she seems so ""mature"" when in fact I think they are about the same age. The special effects, direction, editing and especially the costumes and sets were truly awe-inspiring. I could go on and on about the good features of the film such as how close some actors looked to the characters they played e.g. Capt. Smith, J. Bruce Ismay, Thomas Andrews, Margaret Brown, Ida and Isidor Straus and more. The only downside to Titanic was some sections of the script that were corny and ham-fisted but no film is entirely faultless and I think Titanic deserved all the Oscars it received and, contrary to popular belief, it is not only Leo-maniacs who give this movie it's box-office success and seeing it doesn't turn you into one either. There are many scenes from Titanic that will probably stay with me forever; this film grabs you and won't let you go. The class stereotypes were unfortunate and we don't get an accurate picture of the way many people behaved during the sinking; Cameron seemed to ignore the fact that many first-class men willingly gave their lives and the way First Officer Murdoch was portrayed was disgusting. But apart from those few things it is a triumph for James Cameron and everyone involved in creating Titanic.",/review/rw0436955/?ref_=tt_urv

It is a shame that the money spent on the script amounted to no more than 50 cents!! The characterisations are but unoriginal stereotypes given dull and uninspired words to mouth over the "" amazing special effects "". The social realism was only that of an ignorant American. We are expected to swallow as believable that a 17 year old girl has the knowledge of an Art Historian and the wit to perceive that the works of Degas and Monet will be great some day. The love story between her and Jack Dawson is laughable in its pastiche of great "" cross over "" love affairs.For a film to pride and promote itself on realism it seems unbelievable that social realism is completely lacking.

This film is so much different to those, but in an extraordinary way, this is how I like to see Cameron, making films at top notch! So you've got your basic love couple, one from a rich family, and one living down in the dumps. But the cheesy love story is so much more than that because it takes place on one of the grandest most commonly known ships to ever set sail... TITANIC! Aside from the cheesiness Cameron gets you involved into the history of Titanic in the first 10 minutes of the film, starting with old Rose and her adventures aboard ship at the mere age of just seventeen, and how she meets the young teen heart throb 'jack' (Leonardo DiCaprio). There relationship gradually gets higher throughout the film until finally there hormone crazed minds decide to put it down to the core and fall in love. Not only is she finding it hard to live on the wealthy side of the land because her Mother is loosing money and needs Rose to get married to the evil fiancé 'Cal'. But as the truth comes out the story is forgotten as the star-crossed lovers suffer a more terrible threat, an iceberg smashing into the ship dawning to its death. This magical love story is put behind as Rose and Jack conjure the rising waters and Cal's crazed jealousy washed with a gorgeous tone, melodrama, and dazzling special effects as the once happy couple are taking a thrilling race for survival. This is a definite must for all Cameron lovers, trust me. In my opinion this is better than Avatar (and that's coming from a Cameron crazed lover) the effects are out of this world for the date it actually came out. Seriously if you have not yet seen it, come out from under that rock and get down the store and buy a copy!",/review/rw2529496/?ref_=tt_urv

Cal is deliciously evil, and the references to 'somebody Picasso' and Freud made me laugh. The one thing I disliked about it was the ending, where Rose and Jack are reunited. It would have been so much more powerful if it had been the same scene, but in an empty room ; the clapping of the rest of the cast doesn't seem to fit.

A three-hour-plus period piece that couldn't make its original release date (July 1997) and still ranks as the most expensive film of all time, ""Titanic"" seemed certain to sink when it was finally released in December of 1997. Its opening weekend was unremarkable- it barely reached the top of the box office and made just 10% of its budget back in that first 3 days... but then something amazing happened. Word-of-mouth has never been more explosive than in the case of ""Titanic"". For four straight months, the film dominated the world's box office, as audiences everywhere, young and old, male and female, were swept up by a perfect juxtaposition of adventure and romance. By breaking every box office record and sweeping the Academy Awards, ""Titanic"" was bound to garner a backlash- which may explain why many people seem to write this film off. But try to remember the first time you saw that CGI iceberg hitting the deck (before the Celine's theme song saturated the radio or Leo's face covered the magazines) and you have to agree that ""Titanic"" is truly breath-taking.",/review/rw1069997/?ref_=tt_urv

I see many commenters say they observed closely Di Caprio's acting and didn't like it, but why watch a film to ""observe"" the acting?  Acting is good when you don't notice it's acting.  A script is good when you don't notice any bad lines.  If you look specifically for things then you'll watch a film in an artificial manner and find all sorts of things.  Titanic is to be enjoyed, for many reasons.  The romance is sublime, the special effects are dazzling, the way classes were treated so differently is shocking, the tragedy of seeing those passengers perish is haunting and stayed with me for a couple of days afterwards.

It definitely showed the tragedy of the Titanic because the whole sinking of the Titanic in the movie was done in such detail that you really learned and could feel how tragic it was! For most men to come on here and write bad reviews about this movie, just don't, because the romance between Jack and Rose was for girls and to make the movie a romantic tragedy. Making it a romantic tragedy made the movie more sad so we could feel even more how much of a tragedy it was! Men obviously don't like romance like that, but the way the did the sinking scene was fabulous! I am a girl so I loved the romance between Jack and Rose, and I think that it truly added more to the movie, because you have to have a story line for a movie that you don't want to make a documentary. The story line was amazing because back then everything was about if you are 1st class, 2nd class, or 3rd class, and you could really see how the 3rd class people were treated compared to the 1st class people because Jack was a very, very poor 3rd class man, and Rose was a 1st class woman engaged to such a wealthy man.

The love tale is far too poorly written to maintain interest of the more action-orientated viewer of which the film is partly complex and also too simple to interest someone who loves good character interaction. I believe that the best character in the movie Cal, Billy Zane's character didn't get nearly enough screen time. I laughed heartily at his ""You'd almost pass for a gentleman"" line directed towards Jack and the black and white original footage was very emotional but little things like this, a fraction of its 3 hour duration don't assist an over rated and drawn out film. I may be going against popular opinion but I saw at least 8 better movies than this in 1998 and will see another 8 this year. I'm not totally against the movie but I can't stand a film winning on hype, a good but not great movie. 6/10, man I'm harsh.",/review/rw0436745/?ref_=tt_urv

","I like Titanic a lot and for me personally it's among the best movies ever. I saw it in theatres back in 1998 and now recently bought the DVD.  I must say I'm not much a fan of Romantic movies but what I like so much in here is everything about the ship Titanic itself.  From the first scenes underwater in the present time until the sinking itself near the end of the movie. Also the first day Titanic set sail and the engine rooms are shown are great to watch.  Many times, even during the sinking, they have the camera moving around the ship so great that it really looks like the real thing.  But the best part in special effects no doubt starts with the breaking of the first mast, until the ship goes down under completely.  A good recommendation for all Titanic buffs and romantic souls.  I rated it 10/10 which makes it my 4th favorite DVD title after Ronin, Bad Boys and Rob Roy.",/review/rw0437242/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a lot of intrigue surrounding this incident and a lot of enigma behind this ship. As to whether there indeed was a sinister and cruel conspiracy and a plot hatched to scuttle and to sink this vessel, along with the hopes and the dreams of its crew and its passengers on its maiden voyage to the promised land or the new world or the land of liberty as it was then called, I can only conjecture but all pointers and indicators would seem to suggest so, although I am in no position to say with any degree of certainty. Everyone of its survivors claims or rather claimed an explosion. And the ship snapped in two right down its middle which would suggest that is where the explosion occurred, in the exact mid section, where the engine room and the boilers were probably located. So clearly it could have been prearranged sabotage. Even a head-on collision of a much larger and a much faster vessel with a much larger iceberg will not create an explosive sound. It will result only in a thud and possibly the sound of ice tearing through the metal. Unless a piece of floating ice is incredibly large even a small amount of force would be sufficient to push it and nudge it away from the ships path . It does not take too much force at all to twirl ice cubes in a glass of water. So this lie and this myth about the sinking of the titanic is certainly greater than both the titanic and the iceberg. This could indeed be the first ocean-liner version of the Trojan horse, a massive floating death trap which would turn into a mammoth underwater coffin.",/review/rw6337556/?ref_=tt_urv

","Possibly one of the most overrated films of all time. Mind you, I am not a Titanic hater. I saw the movie, and I cried, and was moved. The sinking scene was heartbreaking. However... For all the hype, the movie isn't that high quality. A sadly cliched story, sub-par acting, historical inaccuracies, and gratuitous use of plot devices is hidden under beautiful scenery, costumes, and great special effects. It's your depressingly average story of rich girl meets poor guy, runs off, parents disapprove, evil boyfriend lurks in background. Quite possibly the best proof of the weak script is the fact that, as you watch the boat sink, and as all the characters' fates come together, it is not Jack and Rose your heart goes out to, but rather the random extras running around, falling off of things, and being trapped insidee the boat. In this, to some degree, there was success. One of the most powerful images in the movie is an old couple just lying on their bed while water floods in beneath them. Again, this movie isn't awful. It's actually pretty good. But it certainly didn't deserve the eight million Academy Awards it recieved. Costumes, yes. Special effects, sound editing, sure. It was all very well put-together. But in the categories of character and plot, where it matters most, the movie falls apart. Even the more recent Pearl Harbor, also hailed for its messy plot, is well-acted and powerful, and you at least LIKE the characters. The powerful performances hold it together. Next time you're at the video store, I'd reccomend Pearl Harbor over Titanic any time. However, Titanic still is not to be missed.

Why does this movie have such a relatively low rating on the IMDb? The record for most Academy Awards (OScars) won by a single movie is eleven. This was only won by three movies, ever: Ben-Hur, The Lord Of the Rings: Return of the King, and Titanic. Out of those Titanic was also nominated for the most (fourteen including its wins.) LOTR:ROTK is in the top ten on the Top 250, and i know Ben-Hur is on there somewhere. If the overwhelming number of Oscar wins and nominations don't tell you enough, here' what I think: Titanic is one of the best movies i've seen. The sub-plots all tie together perfectly, the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing. The acting is brilliant, and the special effects are very well-done.

It had comedy, drama, love, and any other drama you could think of, it was amazing. I could watch this movie everyday because it never gets old. I think it is good for all ages, and at some point in all your lives, you should watch it. I didn't watch it until this year, and i don't know how i lived without seeing it. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic love story.",/review/rw2128104/?ref_=tt_urv

It's a film which will not only strike you in the tear-ducts, but in heart as well.

But either way, does an over-hyped film that didn't live up to it's expectations make it horrible? Absolutely not. And just because you don't like the artist, it doesn't mean you can't appreciate the work. The film isn't supposed to be based upon facts, the Titanic was the foundation used to build one of the greatest love stories in film history.

","When I finally saw Titanic, I was beyond disappointed. In fact, I've been forced to see this movie many times in recent years and every single time I feel nothing but disappointment. A big complain about Titanic has to do with the ""history"" in the movie. Since everyone knows that the ship goes down Oh sorry, spoiler alerts for those who don't know this historical fact Cameron wrote in one of the most forced love stories I've ever seen on film. Yes, the ship hits an iceberg but the crew actually saw the iceberg minutes before the Titanic went down. However, for some reason the ship didn't change course and therefore, the most devastating part of the film wasn't even accurate. Up time that point, Cameron spent over 2 hours, and did I mention this film is 195 minutes long, setting up a sappy love story. Then in the end, Jack didn't even have to die because there was plenty of room for him to lie next to Rose on that board. Titanic is basically about forbidden love and one we've seen that done better about a hundreds times before. I mean, really? You have a movie about one of those most tragic and horrifying ship wrecks in modern history and we have to spend most of the run time with two teenagers from different worlds who are trapped in a forbidden love story?

","I was looking forward to this film for quite some time.  Although I was not a big fan of pretty-boy DiCaprio, I always have like James Cameron's work and I enjoy Kate Winslet (being British of course).  I did however, expect it to be just another Titanic story, nothing being new.  Over here in Britain the hype was not that big.  I am a major film freak but I only heard about the film 2 months prior to it's release!  So I missed all the rumours of over-budgeting, angry actors and flops. So on its day of release I wandered to the cinema to check out this film that I had heard about.  And oh my God! I have always had a morbid fascination of the ship itself (belonging to the Titanic Historical Society for over 5 years now).  But nothing prepared me for the range of emotions I felt during this film.  I left the cinema with misty eyes and heart so full of despairing hope, that I needed some time alone before attempting conversation with anyone. What an absolutely superb account of one of the most terrifying nights of the 20th Century.  For the first time ever, I was transported back in time to feel the passengers' confusion, despair, heartbreak and outrage.  And seeing all through the eyes of our very own Kate Winslet.  I was so relieved when she left the confines of her restricted life to embark on a journey of love with the young Jack.  I was laughing with them as they outwitted the awful Lovejoy, as they ran through the ship.  I was smiling motherly as they explored one another and Rose made the decision to leave the ship with Jack. But it all collapsed around them. I felt their startled confusion as the iceberg hit.  Their decision to alert the horrible Cal and Rose's narrow-minded mother, only to have Jack accused of stealing and taken below.  But Rose wouldn't leave him, and doing what I would have done she left Cal to rescue her beloved Jack.  Her bravery marked, she was pushed into a lifeboat, descending into the black water, never looking away from Jack as he waited on the doomed ship above.  This is where I fell apart.  I couldn't believe she was going to leave him.  But she jumped back on board only to be chased back down into the bowels of the ship by Cal. You know, I think it was essentially his fault that Jack died.  If he hadn't chased them, Jack and Rose could've made it to a lifeboat. I have nothing but respect for the actors who brought these people to life. For the first time in my life I felt as though my heart had been touched by the sight of such unbreakable love only to have my heart ripped out. Well done James Cameron, Leonardo and Kate.  Thank you for making me realise that life is what you make it.  And thank you for teaching me that there are people who let nothing on earth come between them.",/review/rw0436517/?ref_=tt_urv

","If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be overrated. Why people think this is a classic is beyond me. The film retels the disaster of the Titanic, in which a massive cruise ship crashed into an iceberg and sank, killing 1500 people. For the film, the characters of Jack and Rose take center stage. I must say, both actors did an amazing job at replicating two pieces of cardboard with tape-recorders stuck to them. The dialogue is flat and boring. All of the shots almost never show anything of interest. This is a huge disappointment, especially since it came from James Cameron, who has directed so many hits like Avatar, Terminator, Point Break, and Aliens. In terms of creative elements, there are none. The most exciting part of the film was when the ship crashed and started to capsize. For me, this is because I thought that the main characters would die, and I wouldn't have to see them anymore. But alas, this movie can't even give me that satisfaction. The film Titanic is as much of a shipwreck as the boat was. Unwatchable. Unbearable. The only thing that brings me any happiness from this movie is the fact that after this, Leonardo DiCaprio was still able to find work. I am amazed that his career did not go down with the ship after this performance in this movie. In Summary, if you are bored and want to watch a movie about a boat, watch Under Siege. I'm serious.

The remainder of the film is unadulterated energy, delight, sorrow, anticipation, and so on, and it has.

","It's really only half a good film. But then again it's hard to make a romantic film that good anyway. James's Carmon's Titanic has obtained a place for itself in the history of film.

The film has been recognized for it's amazing cinematography and equally stunning visual effects, as well as immaculate sound editing, and an empowering musical score. It's quite an achievement and I have to give James Cameron grabs for it. And unlike most chick flicks Cameron actually has something to talk about rather than just a touchy love story. Like for example the concurrence of rich and poor, because in a disaster situation the amount of money you have in your pocket is not going to save you. There are many classical moments in this film to be remembered. There's three specific scenes that I'm not going to spoil for you that have an incredibly romantic yet tolerable essence to it, but mainly because Cameron delivered it in the very best way possible. The bottom line is that Titanic is a film to be remembered, we remember Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCapprio's wonderful on screen chemistry, Celine Dion's uplifting voice, and James Cameron's exceptional take on the most famous shipwreck ever. You can try and forget this chick flick like you would with any other, but you will not succeed.",/review/rw2278896/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic, dear Titanic.
This was the second movie ever that I cried for after Romeo and Juliet. This was the only movie ever that I cried UNCONTROLLABLY. The sounds and effects are so apt to the storyline and moods. Zane acted his role with devastating and masterly demeanour, Kate portrayed her role of the unwilling bride impeccably. Celine Dion's ' My heart will go on' just adds defiant hope in the face of enormous tragedy. Then to think that the Titanic wasn't just a movie but a re- enactment of a real life event made me cry like a baby that first day I watched it.

The next day he is invited to dinner in first class as a ""reward"" for saving her. Rose's mother who is a very selfish person who only cares for money takes an instant dislike toward him because he is in Steerage. Cal (Zane) is also a very selfish person who is Rose's fiancé.After their dinner Jack invites Kate to come to Steerage and have a fun time. Cal's butler or whatever he was sees Rose in Steerage and tells Cal. Cal is angry and later on he gives Rose a rare blue diamond as a token of love. rose is forbidden to see Jack again but she disobeys Cal. On that same day jack sketches Rose nude with the necklace and then one thing leads to another. Rose and Jack make love. Then Cal see's Rose's drawing in the safe where rose put it along with the diamond. Then he gets an idea he'll frame Jack for stealing the diamond. He sends his butler to skillfully put it in Jack's pocket and then Jack is placed as a prisoner. Rose frantically sets out to look for him and while this is going on the ship is sinking and everybody is evacuating. She finds Jack and they escape to the top of the ship. Since only women and children were going first on boats Rose gets on forcefully by Cal's and her mother's wish. Then suddenly goes up and to Jack she leaves the boat without the people because she only wants to stay with Jack. When the Ship sinks Rose and Jack dive to the bottom there they stay until Jack dies. Then Rose blows a whistle and a rescue comes. And saves her and not JACk. So that was basically it.

","If I had to describe my impression from this film in one word, the word would be `irritation'. James Cameron made a bad-tasted show of one of the greatest tragedies. The plot is simply stupid. The love-story of main characters is absolutely unbelievable and misplaced. It would be better to set such story on a board of some fictitious ship (resembling Titanic if you like). Meanwhile the film about Titanic itself must be as realistic as possible. However, if Cameron failed in presenting the tragedy of the disaster he succeeded in presenting its horror. Visual effects are great. I gave the film two stars for the sake of the only one scene  that one where the ship breaks into two pieces. It's really impressive on a large screen. Titanic becomes worth seeing only after the ship crashes into iceberg. And even then it is spoiled by absurd behaviour of main characters. Furthermore the casting is bad. I liked only Billy Zane as villainous Cal and Victor Carber as unhappy constructor Mr. Andrews (and also some insignificant passengers and members of crew).  DiCaprio can't act at all, Winslet is not very bad but the role is not for her.

","This is my favorite movie ever. I have been watching it since 1998 and it has never gotten old. I loved how the plot of the movie blended so well with the actual events, and the attention to detail was out of this world. The accuracy with the ship's details such as the opulence of the interior First Class areas, the riveting detail on the ship's exterior, the wardrobes of the actors and actresses, it all seemed so real, like time went back to 1912 and stood still, like it was all back again. And the love story between Jack and Rose, oh it was so nice. I love how they had an older Rose telling the story, and when it switched from her now to how she was then. It was awesome! One of my favorite scenes though, is definitely the ""King of the World"" scene because I think that James Cameron really captured the feeling of the time of the Titanic's. She was the largest ship afloat, the finest afloat, and it was during a time when people thought they had nowhere to go but up. Things were changing and getting better all the time with new technologies, and the Titanic was like an icon for that. So the King of the World part is just awesome. Imagine a Third Class passenger winning a ticket like that. You could only imagine that they'd had to have felt that way. And then when the camera comes back and you see the Titanic, proud on the waves in all her glory, it's truly awesome. And then when they zoom in on Captain Smith, beaming proudly, what an awesome way to portray him. You have to wonder if he really felt that way then. How proud he must've felt. The only thing that I didn't like about it was how they portrayed First Officer Murdoch. There were some witnesses who said they heard shots or saw shots being fired, reports of an officer shooting himself that night, but it was never proved. And given the real Officer Murdoch's character, I don't think he did anything like that. Nor do I think any of the officers shot themselves or someone else. They made him out to be a villain that I don't believe he was. Other than the fact that I thought Rose said ""Jack"" one too many times, the movie was near perfect. Totally awesome.

Titanic has a very good music, best costumes, best decoration, best story... It is one of the best film I've seen in my life!!! It was very emotional like film and very beautiful, charming and sad at the same time. The end made me cry in my head. It was so well done! I can't believe that Titanic is such a popular movie! The only thing I didn't like was that the film was TOO LONG!!! Actually, I didn't really mind. It is a very dramatic story. The music was so soft and relaxing and make us dream a lot! The music described very well what was happening in the film and the character's feelings!!! Really enjoyable!!! James Cameron is a true genius. I haven't seen Titanic in 3D but I hope that the 3D was excellent. It was a very good story of love! I could recommend it to little and great children to see it! They might love it! The ship was pretty and wonderfully made!!! Pictures are really amazing.

Ever girl wants to know that her boyfriend would give up his life for her no matter what happens. I hope every guy will give his future girlfriend or his girlfriend now all the respect she deserves.

","Cameron himself confessed to the DVD interview, and it was interesting to tell the story about the Titanic disaster next to the text, and to make a film under the most unbearable inhuman conditions Hollywood was at the time. And if there's a great Titanic and a secret, it's that the film gets on Naotma at all levels, on all levels, on all the different viewers, from those ordinary Umberto Eco to fans of history and even the most picky bruises that find a lot of interesting in layers. It's my main secret to Cameron's movies success is that they disarm the direct and honest. Even spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his paintings, it's kind of small in Hollywood, always painting pictures around real human stories.

29 November 1998,Xenomorph,10," Titanic: The best film ever made
","In no doubt, Titanic from 1997 is the best film I've ever seen, and will probably remain so for a long while. James Cameron has always been one of my favourite directors, and this time, he's made his finest work so far. Hopefully, there's more to come of these top class Cameron films. One day in the end of April 1998 I went into the cinema to see Titanic, and I had waited for months to see it. I thought it would be a really great film, I had great expectations because almost everyone who had seen it said I was so good, and it was a thousand times better than I thought. It's an amazing story about the rich first-class girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) who falls in love with the third-class passenger Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who won his ticket with a lucky hand of poker, and together they experience the kind of love we all want to have, but seldom find. I've never actually appreciated love stories on film, but this film changed my opinion about what really makes a good movie. It's not just cool action scenes, but also romantic love stories. And Titanic has both of them, the best parts of two totally different worlds of filmmaking, combining the best special effects ever and a great love story. This movie has everything, great script, direction, acting, music (James Horner is the best music composer of all time) and a lot of other things. The movie is so perfect, there's almost nothing I've noticed which is wrong. Of course there are things that don't match the real happenings, such as the flashlights from the lifeboat, which never were there in reality. But it's not a documentary, it is a film, and everything does not have to be absolutely correct to make it a good film. James Cameron is the best!",/review/rw0436604/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie portrays how a society based on money = power really function in sticky situation. It gives a fair picture of how unfair this system can work. Along with being a realistic and believable movie, James Cameron manages to hold the audience's attention by evolving the movie and the historic happenings around the beautiful love story that occurs between Rose and Jack. Although the ending might seem unfair (I think I cried my heart out), the moral is that unless you are willing to let go of ""the safe solution"" in life you will never be able to gain something better. She did.  A wonderful movie that will make you laugh, boil with anger, cry, shake your head - you name it. It is absolutely a ""must-see"" movie, that surely will make you think. 10/10 stars!

But as it progresses along, it becomes almost a shot-for-shot remake of ""A Night to Remember"". However, that film was more of an emotional story of opposites colliding and hope conquering hopelessness. This is more of a disaster flick. The biggest problem though, is the lack of charactor development. The film's protaganists (DiCaprio and Winslet) are the only ones who seem to do anything.

The current trend being that people are already bored with computer animations that plagued us since the ""Lion King"" means there is still hope to get a discerning public. The problem with Titanic is that the storyline is too ""linear"", too much, too fast, and not enough time is given to get a good picture of the characters. Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining movie, with fantastic pictures and a lot of action. However, the only attempt at showing characters as they should be is in the (near) final post-disaster scene between Di Caprio and Winslet. Thus I end up being entertained, but no interest whatsoever in the whole movie as such. Just good for watching once, methink.",/review/rw1490074/?ref_=tt_urv

9 July 2019,kaleidoscope_eyess,6," horrible attempt to combine romance and disaster
","While Cameron, the director, felt ""a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster,"" both the romance and the disaster failed. I loved the first part of the film, but my interest quickly lost after the second part began.
The power of the first part of the film lies in its exploration of social class -- my heart melted upon seeing how Jack attempts to behave like an upperclassman and how Rose enjoys Jack's company and his surrounding. I agree this kind of story sounds cliché and the encounter between Rose and Jack is unlikely, but this love story realizes the fairy tale that everyone of us deeply relates and dreams to become true.
However, the second part of the film immediately feels fake, kitsch, superficial and classist. It is lengthy and even melodramatic. For one thing, the most dangerous moment happens probably where Cal goes after Rose and Jack. The film abstains from any realistic and profound depiction of deplorable living condition in light of a disaster. Focusing on Rose, her family and her love interests, the film stages other common people as mere backdrop of the love story of an aristocrat. In the end, it becomes evident that Rose would survive and live a happy life anyway, which promptly overshadows the very existence and sacrifice of Jack.",/review/rw4985230/?ref_=tt_urv

12 June 2008,greendaydagger,10," Lingering Feeling at the End
","The first time I saw this movie was when I was four years old and my mother covered my eyes at almost every scene. Naturally, I remembered how sad the movie was. Something that wouldn't happen for a four year old with most movies though, was that the movie had such a great effect that even years later when I heard the song that was playing at the end I felt sad. Just recently, I re-watched the movie and was blown away. We've all seen movies that leave you with a feeling afterward, whether it be one of happiness, sadness, or anger. This left the viewer with all three of these emotions. It's not hard to guess why it would leave you with a feeling of sadness, but I'd like to point out how strong this lingering feeling was. I cried not only during the whole last hour of the movie, but for thirty minutes afterward as well. I'll admit, I cry easily over movies, but usually the tears stop coming after the first two rounds. The ending of the movie was just amazing. This is left for the viewer to interpret, but when the old lady closes her eyes and the scene shoots to the men on the titanic opening the door for her and Jack is standing at the top of the stairs next to the clock the ending is just turned over from a depressing movie to a very happy one, depending on the readers interpretation. It can be implied that perhaps she is dreaming of him, or she dreams of him every night, but this isn't quite so happy. The reader could also look at it from a logical point of view and say that this is the dream people have in their last 12 minutes of brain activity when they die. However, the most happy and perhaps most common interpretation is that she has indeed died and she is now off to spend an eternity with Jack, her only true love. The movie leaves you with a feeling of anger because you know that Jack didn't have to die. You know that nobody had to die, but the maker of the ship had insisted on going faster and the people loading the safety boats didn't ""Want to risk putting too much weight on"" so while they could have fit 65 people on each they stuck with close to 12. You know, also, that if the dang boats hadn't been so selfish towards the end he wouldn't have died. This is by far the best movie I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone.",/review/rw1891142/?ref_=tt_urv

Towards the end of the film  Bill Paxton's character states that while he was involved very strongly in the search for titanic's treasures ""He never let it in"".

We of course all have heard the story of the Grand Ship that was at the time the Technological marvel of it's day. It's tragic sinking at the hands of an Iceberg in the North Atlantic was a huge blow to Man's quest to conquer nature. Cameron could have easily written a cheesy screenplay and turned it into a 70's Disaster movie, but he has created characters you care about. I've always found that films that have a huge box-office are easy targets for people to criticize, in general most blockbusters don't garner the acclaim that Titanic did.

The scenes of all those people running and screaming extending their lives by mere minutes by going to the highest part of the ship rather than giving in to their destiny really exemplifies the instinct of survival for as long as possible.  It was a very educational movie for young people who did not learn of the tragedy yet and was also a marvelous film for people who knew about the Titanic already.  You could really put yourself in their shoes and feel what it would have been like. It makes you ask yourself many important questions including: 1.  Why must we segregate people according to class, etc.? 2.  If you were a man, could you have behaved like a ""gentleman"" and stayed behind? 3  If you were a wife, could you have left your husband on that ship and gotten into the life boat without him? 4.

I expected to see a meticulous depiction of the ship itself as well as a harrowing re-enactment of the sinking. What I did not expect was to be as moved by the human story. Several people have asked why Cameron felt he had to include a fictional love story in a story about a real-life tragedy. First, the Jack-Rose love story gave the moviegoer a chance to see most of this great ship while exploring the different worlds of first-class and steerage. Secondly, and most important of all, Cameron felt that if he made you care about the fate of two fictional people,it would make the fate of the 1500 real people who died on the Titanic seem more tangible and concrete.",/review/rw0436665/?ref_=tt_urv

12 August 2003,dbbilby,5," Good portrayal of a ship, less that admirable plot.
","I think that one thing about this film that is easily overlooked is that Cameron brings us a very accurate and realistic portrayal of the ship itself and the disaster that resulted from negligence of the ship's designers and crew.  However, it is served up in a story that focuses on useless and unrealistic dialogue, essentially a generic love story that is written to cater to the masses. The film is written such that we see the modern day underwater wreckage at the beginning of the film, as much as we may see on a half hour special on the discovery channel, then transitions to the past to show us the ship in all of its grandeur.  The love story leads to a romp of the ship, showing all of the types of passengers, their quarters, and how they lived aboard the ship during the short trip across the Atlantic.  Cameron also managed to show us all the major parts of the ship, including the decks, the engine, and the storage areas.  To weave all of this into the story is a notable accomplishment in itself. The film falters in its attempt of a realistic portrayal of attitudes and ideas during the time in which it is set.  Many ideas and actions that are not true to the time period penetrate the plot, as Cameron attempts to tell a historic story in a fashion that is tailored for audiences nearly a century later.  The result is a more of a fantasy meets documentary than a realistic film. People who enjoy the love story tend to proport that this is a good film. Since there is so much focus on the DiCaprio-Winslet superstar combination, however, others will overlook the accurate portrayal and the realistic sets, and claim that the movie is a waste of tape.  Although Cameron managed to woo love stricken audiences, he fell short of reality on the plot.",/review/rw0437708/?ref_=tt_urv

It merges both the mind and the heart. Also, the music was so perfect that you may even burst into tears just by listening to the music itself. What I loved most about it was the script method and the way of reminding us of the Titanic. We saw old Rose at first, then she began to explain all she knew about the Titanic. That was the time when we got a chance to compare the Titanic which sank to the Titanic which lives in Rose's mind on the screen. Fantastic! To all those who criticize the movie for being nothing more than a love story, I don't know if this love story is true but everybody knows that a lot of people on that ship who loved each other died, didn't they?

This I found incredibly irritating as I was desperate for more focus on what was going on anywhere else but with Jack and Rose. What is most ridiculous is that the film even makes point of introducing the Captain and other historically accurate characters, only to ignore them until the climax.

For me, the most interesting part of this film is Bill Paxton and his mates going to examine the ship in present day. The rest of the story descends into a bloated, overly sentimental blur of over dramatic emotions as Billy Zane suddenly goes loony and Celine Dion's heart goes on and on and on...

16 August 2011,jokimaa87,," A nice movie made for entertaining
","It is easy to understand why falling in love as a teenager feels so dramatic, extraordinary and ""out-of-control"", because usually our brains don 't develop as fast as our hormone levels rises in our bodies. In the case of Jack and Rose, short romance on a sinking ship means a lot for them on a personal level. Rose is a prisoner of his mom who wants to sell her daughter to a rich man in order to support herself. From that viewpoint she seeks a person who could set her free emotionally from her mother. So she ends up to fall in love with a poor young man, who has nothing else to offer her but that masculine freedom of his. No money, just a feeling of independence. So on an emotional level, this is much about a young woman and her struggle against the overly controlling mother and the gender role of her time through passionate romance with Jack. To be a bit cynical, Jack 's death is not important when it comes to the message of this story but the idea of freedom he gave to her. Love doesn't die when the loved ones die because the very idea of love is to form a human. The more it forms you the greater the love has been. So it doesn't matter if it 's just a petty teenage romance if it means life to you as it did in the case of Rose. Jack saved her life in a way and that was the message of the story.Even if the essence of this film was the love story, it is as much a portrayal of social classes, gender roles, way of life and the strong faith in development during the time of Titanic. This is entertaining film for masses and in that category pretty well done.",/review/rw2474963/?ref_=tt_urv

","Review Title: Titanic Media: Film/Movie Genre: Action, Disaster, Drama, Romance Description: Titanic is a movie about a love story taken place on a ship that was known for being un-sinkable. Two main characters are Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The two played two different classes of people that weren't supposed to fall in love, but did. On the voyage, the ship and everyone on it came across a huge iceberg. They tried to miss it but the size was larger than what was expected. The ship split down the middle, throwing everyone off causing more than 1,500 people to drown and freeze to death. Backstory: Now 101 years old, Rose Dewitt Bukater (played by Kate Winslet) told her granddaughter and the Keldysh crew about her life in 1912 April 10th. When Rose was younger she abroad Titanic with her upper-class mother and fiancé. Also, at the time, Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) played a game with his friends for a third-class ticket on the ship. The two were not meant to be together, not even meant to come across each other. The two days on the Titanic before the horrible incident occurred, Rose and Jack spent most of the time there with each other. He drew her like one of his ""French girls"" wearing only the rarest diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. The romance kept getting deeper, but her fiancé had a different plan for them. Out of jealousy, her fiancé, Cal, locks Jack into a room, handcuffed and not able to get out. While Jack is in the room, where no one can hear him yell to get him out, the ship collides with the iceberg. Rose goes and looks for Jack and the ship is beginning to take on water. Finally, Rose gets Jack out and they go to the top to get on a rescue boat to stay alive. As the ship lowers, Jack and Rose are fighting death of the freezing water. Unfortunately, Jack did not make it alive but Rose did. After 84 years, Rose began to tell her heroic, tragic, but love story while being on the ""unsinkable"" ship, Titanic. Judgment: Titanic is one of the best movies that was made. It was well informative on what took place in 1912. It showed the history, the disaster, and the love that was taken place on the historical ship. It has a full story of events that occurred and it was well acted and directed. Reasons/Evidence: Rose Bukater told her story. There was actual footage of the sunken ship. The producers and crew told the whole story and not a short section of it. The movie had a budget of $200 million dollars, which showed everything that happened from start to end. Relevant Comparisons: Avatar, The Notebook, Forrest Gump Criteria: 1. Is the story real? 2. Is the acting good? 3. Did it look fake? 4. Does it have a good story? 5. Was all the history correct?",/review/rw3654847/?ref_=tt_urv

As the story goes on we get crappy flashbacks from the past to the present and hear an old lady explaining her true love. And to make it worse the movie is 3 hours and 19 minutes long making every second of the movie even more painful. When i first watched this movie at home i checked my watch every other second and got tired of the storyline and skipped scenes. In my opinion it would be just easier to cut the movie down to 2 hours and 10 minutes instead, but then again this is James Cameron. Known for making long movies and crappy story lines.

This film is more than just a love story, and many people will agree. The special effects that appear in this movie are spectacular. Well honestly if you're going to spend over $200 million dollars on making a film, it should be at least spectacular. The real reason this movie was excellent was because of Jim Cameron's undying devotion to the project's perfection. He did countless retakes of key scenes, got behind the camera himself many times, and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind. The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to an imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on something historical, and a film to idolize for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time.

The dialog has been dumbed down so that people of this day and age could understand what the characters were saying, secondly the title Titanic may be a little misleading. This movie, though based highly on the ship, can't help but steer away from the point of the movie. No one can disagree that Titanic is in most part a love story and stories about people sailing on the Titanic. But even with these minor follies, it never stopped me from buying the tape and watching it countless times, to buying the DVD and watching it countless times.

Some people would say Leonardo, and I agree he does draw crowds, some would argue the special effects, and again these were great, but the real reason is that James Cameron made the movie with something in it for everyone. For the ladies, Leo, for the men, Kate, for the sadists, lotsa people being frozen, for the historians, an (almost) perfect recreation of the Titanic, for the women who love a good tear-jerker, the tragic story of Jack and Rose, for the music lovers, a fantastic score by James Horner, for everyone who likes a bit of action, the intense edge-of-your-seat last hour. There truly is a reason for absolutely everyone to see this movie. For all those people who don't fit into any of the above categories, you've seen it too, why?

But that is all it is and when you compare it to other Best Picture winners then it is nothing special and is for example inferior to Braveheart or Platoon. The only bad parts of Titanic are the flying scene and the Jack dying scene. Those scenes just make you embarassed in pain. Excluding those scenes the film is for the most part great. For example the opening or closing scenes are pure cinema perfection with emotional musical score that send emotions through your whole body. In fact even though there were a couple better movies since Titanic none had better single moments than a couple moments of absolute perfection in Titanic. However this is not a perfect movie and is in fact the most flawed James Cameron movie. How could Cameron go so over the top with the love story and keep a cheesy ""flying"" scene. If you want to watch Cameron at his best then watch Terminator 2 but otherwise watch this and expect a couple of embarassments.",/review/rw0437636/?ref_=tt_urv

I hate its attention to detail, while forgetting to pay attention to the PLOT. There was a reason that the script and Leo DiCaprio weren't nominated for an Oscar: they sucked.

Setting a love story against the back-drop of the doomed liner was bound to be a world-wide success, in fact the film is probably more well known than the ship was! Unfortunately, the film does lose something when it is not on a big screen as a TV screen (in my opinion) does not to justice to the sets, which are exquisite and match the luxury of the actual ship. Although I found the love story a little disappointing, it works remarkably well and keeps you guessing until the end what's going to happen to Jack and Rose, and the fact that they run practically through the entire ship as she's sinking give the special effects ample time to shine! For me, the film steps up a gear after the Titanic hits the iceberg, and you as the audience become enthralled in watching the chaos that ensues. (May I point out at this point that Officer Murdoch did not shoot anyone or himself, in fact what actually happened to him still remains a mystery).

","Titanic is an emotional, heart wrenching roller coaster type of film. One minute you will be laughing at how cute Leonardo DiCaprio is and the next minute you will be crying as you watch the ship sink into the deep ocean. The film's sole purpose was to one, show the history of the ""unsinkable"" ship, but on the other hand it takes a closer look at the passengers on the ship. There were two different types of people on the Titanic, the upper class, which was filled with the wealthy and well off people, and then there was the lower class, full of poor and not so well off people. As the movie progresses you see who belongs to where and how the classes get along with each other. As it introduces the characters, we the audience all fall in love with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) so does Rose (Kate Winslet). Rose is a young, gorgeous, wealthy girl traveling back to America to marry her horrible fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane), and Jack is a cute, intelligent, but poor boy who snuck onto the ship. In this interesting romance between Rose and Jack there's also a panic rising deep within Cal as he begins to realize there just might be something going on between Jack and Rose. Rose and Cal are part of the upper class and their costumes and dialogue really show their class well. By this i mean that Rose and Cal wear nice and neat clothes and expensive jewelry and they speak all proper and tight and clean. On the other hand you have Jack, he's part of the lower class and dresses kind of sloppy and in rags it looks like and his slang is in no comparison to the proper way of speech the class above him uses. Still though, Jack and Rose can see past each others flaws and riches and manage to fall in love almost instantly. But putting the romance and drama aside, there's something even more interesting about to happen, a mysterious iceberg. As we all know the ship Titanic is indeed, sinkable. As the ship is sinking, that's when things become real and suspenseful and emotional and scary. You're on the edge of your seating biting your nails literally praying for the inevitable. On another note, James Cameron did an amazing job recreating a completely believable Titanic. I honestly thought it was real i had no idea he recreated it on a computer. The sinking scenes were just as horrific on screen as they were the night it was a reality to so many people. I was so transfixed onto the screen i couldn't believe it. The cinematic for this movie were incredibly believable and just utterly beautiful. I do not think anyone else could have done a better job at recreating such a horrific night but still make it into a love story at the same time. The music was yet another memorable aspect of this film. It was warming and heart touching during the love scene. It then turned into a calm serene as the violinists play while the ship is sinking. When Jack and Rose are ""flying"" at the bow of the ship, the music that is playing was used for the mood and for the effect of the emotions being displayed on Rose's face as Jack touches her to help her ""fly"". The music is used to perceive the mood and emotions being displayed during a particular scene. Whether it was calm to frantic, or warm love back to sad with sorrow, the music was used in a most incredible way and it really made the scenes pop and stand out to me. Lastly, in my opinion you don't just watch this type of movie, you really feel everything the characters are feeling. When they were crying or screaming, then you were too. When Jack and Rose are falling madly in love, I was too. James Cameron set this amazing atmosphere for his audience that just reels us in and we can't be pulled out. Over all i can say that i love this movie. The historical details were on point, the story-line was just utterly beautiful but heart wrenching as well, the cinematography was used amazingly, and the music and characters were portrayed nicely. This film as both thumbs up from me!",/review/rw3334105/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is a very popular movie since 1997 until nowadays. The movie is about actor nae JACK and actress name ROSE that fall in love with each other without thought about the richness or poorness. Rose is a daughter of rich family that will gonna have engagement with the person who she doesn't love from all her heart. Jack is a poor guy but very talented in drawing. Jack rescued Rose when Rose is about to jump from the ship into the sea. And they start chatting, and give Rose advice to live happiness and do something that Rose never done before.

","The tragic story of a maritime disaster coated with a true love story. The story line of love breaking the social class barriers really is beautiful. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are beautifully paired in this heartfelt film about breaking free and living your life the way that you want and not the way your social class tell you to. Kate Winslet's portrayal of the class restricted Rose, who is fed up with her stiff upper lip family and the restrictions of being a first class woman. Being forced into an unhappy marriage to the over bearing and big-headed millionaire Cal she even considers suicide. Whilst sailing to America on the R.M.S. Titanic, Rose meets Jack Dawson, a third class passenger. During the journey they have a whirlwind affair of passion. But the Distaster strikes as the ship hits an ice berg and sinks.

","There has been so many movies about the Titanic before but what makes this one stand so high above the rest is that it actually brings the audience in where it no longer feels like another fact based story that we all know about. It becomes much more than that. I can appreciate some peoples criticism over the movie being based on 2 fictional characters and that they feel it overshadowed the sinking of the great ship but in my opinion, that's why we, as an audience feel so overwhelmed. With these 2 characters we get to learn what it was like for the poor as well as the rich and many people lost their loved ones that night so really I feel that the ship was full of Rose and Jack's. I admit it really takes off when the ship hits the iceberg and it was great to follow these characters right until the ship sinks. James Cameron has done a brilliant job of bringing the audience in because you find yourself constantly asking ""What if that was me?"". I feel that this movie certainly does the ship and all those actual people on it justice. It's a tragic reminder of what they actually went through.

19 August 1999,Salieri-3,8," The greatest thing made by the hands of man
","Not only is ""Titanic"" the greatest film ever made, it is truly the greatest thing made by the hands of man. This comment is limited to 1,000 words - I would need a limitless page to explain why. But I will say this. The Titanic represented everything that the people of 1912 hoped that this century would be like. It represented the illusion that we had finally conquered nature. But we were wrong. When Billy Zane says, 'It is unsinkable - God himself could not sink this ship' - you can almost see, high above the clouds, God saying 'Oh yeah? We'll see about that!' ""Titanic"" - the movie - is not only a mesmerising, beautifully made, heart-wrenching, uncompromisingly realistic film, but it is a true meditation on not only mankind's progress through this century (which began at the end of the gilded age and is now finishing at the dawn of the digital age), and on the human condition itself. James Cameron, having established himself as the action maestro with ""Aliens"" and ""T2"", finally proved not only that he was willing to totally defy and redefine the auteur theory, to ignore the cynics and the unfathomable opinions of people who think that ""A Night to Remember"" is the definitive account of the disaster (calling planet earth, do you think that on a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone, everything would be done in a smooth, cool, calm, orderly fashion? Eh?), and forget about codes, conventions and 'film theory', in order to make the film the way he saw fit, but that he is a human being. When Steven Spielberg made ""Schindler's List"" (in my opinion the #2 film of all time), it was a big break, considering among other things the fact that he had just finished ""Jurassic Park"", but he had made real human dramas before - ""The Color Purple"" and ""Empire of the Sun"". Cameron had shown that action movies could have real production values, but a true human drama was a totally new thing. The film HAD to be made before this century was out. I was only two when Cameron's big break - ""The Terminator"" was released, but I can imagine a lot of people thinking that this man would be the one to make THE Titanic movie (technology versus mankind, anyone?). As well as the powerful messages (more than you're likely to find in a state-of-the-art digital communication system), the film has unchallengably breathtaking grandeur, awe-inspiring beauty, an excellent cast, a moving storyline, and totally absorbing AND thought-provoking entertainment. When Cameron and fellow producer Jon Landau received the Best Picture Academy Award last year, the final moment was the moment Cameron had been building up to throughout his career. He summarised what the film meant to him, and spoke as human being, not as a Hollywood director, when he called for a moment's silence in honour of the 1,500 men, women and children who went down with the ship. By faithfully recreating the disaster and giving it mass appeal in uncountable ways, Cameron has made a document of the human condition, the 20th century and what it brought about, and social, moral and technological progress that will surely stand the test of time, and, maybe, one day, when those snobbish critics have a 'live life to the full, you never know when it could end' experience, will make them realise that ""Citizen Kane"" (excellent but overrated) is NOT the greatest film ever made. But then, we are all human beings, and we are all different, and the right to freedom of expression is a right we all should have - one of the film's many messages. Perfect freedom does not exist, but we can be free from oppression if we let other people and exterior forces work with us. In ""Titanic"", the ship in question represents Rose's gilded cage, and the limitations of her society, but, ultimately, it (she, sorry) becomes her means of salvation - both in that it/she brings her to Jack, and in that it/she sinks, therefore changing the lives of all the survivors. Dramatic license works its wonders in the scene when Jack and Rose go up on deck having just been 'doing it' in the car, Rose decides that she is going to forsake her money and her family and get off at New York with Jack, she kisses him, the lookouts look down and see them - but when they look ahead, what do they see? The rest is history. Although many critics were critical of this film, the fact that it is both the most popular AND the most honoured film of all time is a testimony to the value we place upon our freedom, and upon life itself. Not a day goes by when I don't think about the awesome wonder of that film, neither will I ever forget how it changed my life. Every time I watch it I notice something new. James Cameron is the greatest artist in the history of mankind. Dedication, passion and commitment were taken to new levels with ""Titanic"".

","Depending on what crowd you're a part of, it may be cool to your friends to like *everything* that is popular without forming your own opinion.  Or, conversely, it might be cool to *hate* everything popular without thinking about it.  This seems to be the basis of most amateur reviews of Titanic I 've read.  The truth is that this is a terrific film which emotionally chronicles the death of 1500 people on a doomed luxury liner.  Every movie needs a plot, though, or the fantastic last third of the film would have no meaning.  I am not a particular fan or detractor of either Leo, Kate, or James, but all three work their professions to perfection.  Jim writes and directs the film with real feeling and intelligence, and only in the movies is dialogue also perfect.  There is never any confusion as to what is going on at any moment, and Leo and Kate both give outstanding performances as the doomed lovers.  The historical characters are cast with uncanny resemblance (especially E. J. Smith), and the effects are so perfect that you hardly realize that what you're looking at is not real, and probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been told.  Horner's soundtrack is at first wondrous, and becomes haunting as Titanic's fate is sealed.  My only bone is that Cameron doesn't know port from starboard.  The bottom line is that this is one of few films I've seen where the fate of the characters is of utmost importance to the viewer.  You know Kate survives the wreck, and Kathy Bates as well, but what about the rest.  These characters have the feeling of being real, breathing, men and women, and for good reason:  many of them *were*.  This is not a tragedy that belongs in a pop culture tug of war.  I've seen the film only twice, and have been moved both times.  And perhaps the best thing about historical dramas like this is best summed up in Hitchcock's own view on suspense.  When the viewer knows the potential outcome, but the characters don't (Hitchcock explained it as two men at a table discussing baseball, while only the viewer is privy to the fact of a bomb ticking beneath the table). Titanic is a marvelous film, and the budget, politics, etc, involved in the Hollywood aspect of this memorable masterpiece are moot.  If the film had not won an Oscar, it would still be among the five best films in the 100 year history of cinema.",/review/rw0437083/?ref_=tt_urv

","Perhaps my expectations ran too high when I watched this movie, but I'm rather inclined to think that this is the most overrated movie that's ever been made. Although the historical facts are of course known, the story holds no surprises at all and the characters are full of clichés which makes it really hard to watch the whole movie without being lulled to sleep or bored to death. Of course, it's a very emotional film with a romantic love story, but the lovers stay two-dimensional unless you happen to be a true Leonardo-di-Caprio-fan, and as I haven't been one before, I certainly won't be one now. As to the ship's sinking itself, which is what the average viewer might have paid for to watch, it's probably impressive and satisfying for most viewers, but I think it is reaching our lowest instincts by satisfying our greed to watch catastrophes from a safe distance, e.g. your living-room or local theater, and gladness it's not us who are fighting for life.

James Cameron spent his whole life's effort on Titanic. Every actor, each crew member were lost in the story during making of this film. There are no mistakes at all.

","Most people are too critical of Titanic.  I think that it was one of the best movies that I have ever seen.

The special effects in the movie wer also some of the best I've seen and even if they weren't, that wouldn't change the fact that the script, casting, acting, and directing were superb.  Some movies make it even without having good visual effects, for example, Star Wars. Before the remake of it, it's special effects were very out-dated, but people still liked it.  Titanic's special effects were amazing and created a sense of feeling for not only the characters but the ""unsinkable"" ship as well.  Rose and Jack also left an incredible amount of compassion in me because of the way that they showed their undying love and promise too each other.  Titanic, too me, is a well-rounded good movie because it appeals to all audiences, contains both elements of love and action, and tells an age -old story of courage and strength against the odds.  For those who say that Titanic is too predictable, they ""never really let it sink in.""  The true story of Titanic doesn't lay in their hearts.",/review/rw0436999/?ref_=tt_urv

","The simple fact is that the lead characters are badly-written cliches serving a formulaic story.  The rich/poor conflict is overdone, and not believable (and the suffering of those below versus the comfort of those above amid the chaos of the sinking ship an exaggeration of history at best). Virtually every line spoken by the lead actors is wooden, false, unbelievable; it is hard to judge the acting when the actors -- who have shown considerable talent elsewhere -- are given such awful things to say>  I do think Zane looks particularly bad here, but I'd give everyone a benefit-of-doubt due to the script.  The frame story is of course ridiculous, but we could say the same thing about _Citizen Kane_; the difference is that the latter film is beautifully photographed, superbly acted,impressively composed, brilliantly edited, sophisiticated in its use of sound, and extremely well-written.  _Titanic_ is most interesting when it shows us historical figures:  Kathy Bates' Molly Brown is impressive (though her intervention in the love story is utter nonsense, and again because it is made up and badly so).  The engineer whose awareness of the fact that there are not enough boats to save everyone is also interesting.  The story of the band playing on, whatever they may have actually played (there is some debate), was handled in a fairly moving way.  There is a lovely shot of an elderly couple resting in each other's arms, awaiting the end; this too echoes at least one such wealthy couple who chose to die together rather than be separated amid the ""women and children first"" calls.  The ship's demise looks impressive, and of course is welcome, given the excessive length of the film.  But overall the film sinks in one-dimensional characters spewing out one-dimensional lines(to even characterize some of them as one-dimensional is charitable)over one-dimensional music.  The _Terminator_ films and _Aliens_ are more believable and show more depth (though if we'd listened carefully to Hamiliton's lines in the second T film, we might have foreseen _Titanic_'s aesthetic failure).",/review/rw0436486/?ref_=tt_urv

30 December 1999,SneakyJoker,10," Titanic: An Incredible Experience
","James Cameron's ""Titanic"", is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made. The intricate love story, set on board one of the 20th century's worst disasters, was superb. The score, the visuals, the special effects, the acting, etc.....all combined to make this film the phenomenal achievement that it is. This film pulls you back in time to 1912, on board the famous ship with its doomed passengers. You come to feel close to Jack and Rose, all the while aware that certain doom is just ahead of them. The film is sobering and fittingly emotional, as too many lost their lives. Husbands and wives torn apart forever, as were large and small families, and of course...Jack and Rose. At least until the end, when Rose finally passes away and returns to Jack...on board Titanic. ""Titanic"" is absolutely spellbinding, engrossing, and an incredible film experience.

","This movie is amazing. I love History and I love love stories so this movie makes for my favorite movie of all time. The suspense in the film is amazing, the detail incredible and the story-line is outstanding. I connect so well with Rose, I can understand everything about her and why she does everything. I can imagine me being Rose. I don't connect so well with Jack as a character, though that is probably because 1) Rose is the one telling the story and 2) Jack is a male and I am female. Kate Winslet is an awesome actress in this movie. She shows Rose so well and I can see the hopeful but clouded and misled young girl who is trapped into being a graceful, perfect woman so well. The depth of love between Jack and Rose is inspiring. This film reminds me a bit of Romeo and Juliet, where the two meet and quickly fall in love. I also love the way that James Cameron weaved so many facts about the event into the film. It would of been easy to turn this into a big, over-dramatic story where Jack becomes a hero and saves everyone on board by swimming the ship on his shoulders, or the ship explodes into a thousand pieces because of a wiring problem and everyone has to live on the ice-bergs or well, you get my drift. The point is that it doesn't. It sticks to the facts so well and I can imagine this story happening on Titanic. I can see this being a real story. And don't even get me started on the special effects. The attention to detail everywhere is enchanting. The way that the ship crumbles next to the ice-berg and how the water bursts into the compartment suddenly leaves you gasping.",/review/rw1451311/?ref_=tt_urv

","Given Cameron's apparent interest in the actual tragic event and the money that was spent this film borders on being a travesty as it was an opportunity lost to tell one of the great stories of our recent history.
I watched Titanic from start to finish the other night and came away completely disappointed that most of the very interesting elements of the real saga were either glossed over or omitted completely and replaced by a schmaltzy implausible drawn out love story.
Given the budget and the state of the art effects used this movie could have been great. Had it properly examined the tragedy from the point of view of the real characters involved and their reactions and behaviour instead of some hokey fabricated Romeo and Juliet theme complete with ludicrous villainy and gun-play, it could have been a true classic simply by portraying the multitude of real and totally compelling stories that occurred.
Where was the re-telling of the infamous role the Californian played as it was anchored 10 miles away during the whole terrible ordeal, oblivious and indifferent to the horror being played out within arms reach? Where was the heroics of the Carpathia turning off all heating in order to make more speed as she rushed through the dangerous ice field to rescue over seven hundred souls?
Where was Captain Smith's refusal to believe the ship could not stay afloat after the collision and the unforgettable moment of grim realisation that the Titanic would surely sink? And what about all of the heart rending decisions being made as the men hastily and gallantly chose to put the lives of their women and children before their own? Surely these tragic separations between fathers and their wives and children carried 100 times more feeling and emotion than a pair of smitten teenagers who had only known each other for a couple of days.

Andrews sips his brandy and turns back the clock on the mantle, an old couple embraces and weeps as water rushes up to the bed, the ensemble soberly plays its final pieces together, a preacher delivers a final prayer with a mass of hands clinging to him. Those are the scenes which make ""Titanic"" the cinematic juggernaut it has become.

The real triumph in Cameron's rendering of the sinking is that he put a human face on it...as did Gibson re the Crucifixon. This is a timeless movie that I can watch again and again.

","""Titanic"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" have much in common:  both were enormous, sprawling, troubled productions, and both dealt with actual historical events. But their place in history is based more on their pop-culture influence than on their presentation of these events. They both have some extraordinarily beautiful sequences, yet both are hampered by clunky dialogue and some painfully inept performances. (Billy Zane would have looked right at home in a dinner theater production with all of his histrionics). And it has been well documented that their creators (in the case of ""GWTW"", that would be producer Selznick, not any of the five or more directors) were obssessed with their respective creations. And certainly, each consumed tremendous amounts of money, though their earnings seemed to justify the expenditures. But it begs the question-what is the morality of spending so much (""Titanic""-$200M) when there is so much actual need in the world?

","OK, so Titanic may not be everyones idea of a great film. And I agree with them. Despite his good intentions, Cameron has apparently used the tragic disaster that was Titanic as the backdrop for a forbidden romance. Now I am an enthusiast of the Titanic, and know quite a bit about it. And because of this, I raised a few questions in my head. What about the Californian, the ship whose captain was blamed for standing by and doing nothing (which was proved wrong 60 years after the sinking)? If you look carefully as the ship leaves port, the stacks are red! Now this is potentially historically accurate. Had the ship lived, she would have these colours put on when Cunard took over the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company (or White Star Line). But for the film it is wrong. There was too much emphasis on the love story, but seeing the two lovebirds run around the huge interior of the ship did give a nice tour! However, it did start to get annoying after a while, because I only watched it for the ship! The underwater scenes were credible, well executed, and looked very good. It was a very good and dramatic way that the ship was portrayed sinking, and when the stern is in the air, and the lights go out and the ship breaks her back, it really brought a few shivers as the windmill sized screws slammed back into the water, crushing a few people on the way. In conclusion, the story of the sinking was very well played out, the love story was good to a point, after which it got a bit tedious, and the whole essence of ""panic"" as the ships complement realise the great liner is irreversibly sinking beneath their feet is excellent. I especially enjoyed watching the engine room scenes. However, if Cameron ever makes another film about a luxury liner going down (Lusitania HINT HINT) then would he be so kind as to not put a love story into it, because really, the film only succeeded because girls went to see the ""pretty boy"" actor make his debut, and ended up sobbing because he had to ""die"".",/review/rw1239592/?ref_=tt_urv

The first time I watched Titanic, I almost focused and be amazed of the unsinkable Titanic. For some reason, I did not recognized the hidden message conveying throughout the film which were the meaning of freedom, the power of true love, the right to live, the trust in God, the price of an action and the devil inside anyone. It teaches me that even if a person can live in the richness and has power, it does not mean that person has freedom. A person actually has a freedom when he/she is himself/herself. Look at Rose when she joined the dancing party in the third-class desk, she enjoyed and felt free. The film also persuade me that when someone loves someone from their heart, there is no boundary that they cannot overcome. How Rose could leave behind the richness and how Jack gave his life to her were the meaning of how love works in this real life. Everyone has the right to live, no matter where they come from. A person can be the owner of the greatest building in this world while others have just a penny in their pocket, they have the same right to live this life and money can not steal that genius right from anyone else.Above all, I understand that every action a person makes always has its price and that person will be responsible for any decisions he makes. It really teaches me how to deal with important decisions in my life and help me to figure out how to be the good person and prevent me of nurturing the devil inside of me...Titanic is a good film to watch over and over again.

First of all, as someone who has seen this film many times at the theaters, the notion that teenage girls were responsible for making Titanic the huge success it was because of their obsession with Leonardo is completely wrong. In fact, they were probably in the minority in the audience.  What I saw was an older group of people coming to see this movie--probably at the urging of one of their grown children. In addition, I witnessed substantial representation of our city's  oriental community at most the showings. Obviously, this movie transcended age and ethic barriers; that's what made it the success it was! Was the dialog corny in some places?  Of course it was, just like in real life romances! Could they have developed the characters more?  Yes, but the movie is already over 3 hrs long, how much development do you want? Finally, this movie was very costly to make, and some say it was a waste of resources.

","It's been almost six years since the release of 'Titanic' and there are still two views on it: love it, hate it. Inevitable, I suppose, with a movie like this. A lot of the complaints go to the script, the romance, Leo DiCaprio. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, of course, and those who hate it will probably never love it. I do, however, think that the success of the movie is justified. Bashed before it was even released, it didn't ""sink"" like many predicted it would. The main reason for this may be the fact that this movie brought to life the actual tragedy of what happened to the ship in 1912. It isn't so much about how ""shallow"" the script was - the ship and it's passengers were brought to life. The passengers were shown as real human beings, like you and me, who had hopes and aspirations. Tragedies usually get type-cast for the number of victims, and we tend to forget that each of those numbers was a person with a story. The movie placed the viewers on that ship and made us feel with the people aboard. The fictional story of Jack and Rose - which, IMHO, is a moving love story - gave us an emotional focal point, and made the tragedy much more personal. You may hate the film, and it's actors (although, they are all perfectly cast and superb actors, not just in 'Titanic'), but the tragedy of what happened, and the idea that life is there to be lived, no matter what fate may have in store for you, is what makes this movie special and appealing.",/review/rw0437740/?ref_=tt_urv

It also earned 7.7 stars on IMDb public voters.

","This movie is the most successful movie (in terms of box-office numbers) of all time, because of the ""Kool-Aid factor"". People got so wrapped up in the sweeping trend of thought that the movie was great, that most of them were not judging it objectively. In reality, it isn't a BAD movie, it's just not great. The special effects and Kate Winslet look great in the movie. While we're on the subject, Leonardo DiCapprio is someone else who is overrated. He's....OK. He was very good in ""The Basketball Diaries"", and he was decent in ""The Aviator"" and ""The Beach"". I was NOT impressed, however (unlike most people), with his performance in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". He didn't play a mentally handicapped kid -- he played a ""retard"". What I mean by that is, that he was doing more of a caricature or stereotype of a mentally handicapped person. Well, enough about that for now....",/review/rw1223104/?ref_=tt_urv

8 October 1999,Lil Alex,10," Why do people hate this film?
","I think people hate this film because they are letting the hype about the film interfere with how they see the film.  Don't judge a film based on outside influences.  Don't hate it because Cameron is an egomaniac.  Don't hate it because 14 year old girls went 20 times just to see Leo.  Don't hate it because they played that song 10 times a day for a year.  Hate it because you hate the movie itself, what was on the screen and that alone. If you but all the hype aside I think you will see a truly great film.  A film that succeeds on many levels.  Special effects, acting, music, action, humor, historical, moral, philosophical.  Did I miss one? I'll admit I love Cameron films.  I don't however typically like ""chick"" flicks, and this is partially a chick flick.  But it is also an ""action"" flick. Does it go on to long.  I say about 5 minutes.  I hate the part with the stupid kid screaming alone in the hallway.  Other than that it's perfect in just about every way.

","Some people will look for anything to criticize this movie.  I recall one user comment complaining that the ship didn't have any bow waves.  Oh dear God no!  I usually can't stand the tedium of romance movies, but I found this one to be very entertaining, although I think DiCaprio should try a push-up one of these days.  By the way, great career ditching ""American Psycho"" for ""The Beach"".  Anyway, some criticism I'd like to offer is Billy Zane's character.  I realize that he is the predesignated bad guy, but does his character really have to be so unoriginal?  I'd like to have seen him as a real person and not equipped with the default personality for villains. Of course, I guess all the other main characters are pretty much just as unoriginal, but I enjoyed the movie anyway.  I recollect releasing an especially malignant laugh upon the weeping audience as I witnessed Leonardo's frozen, pretty little face dwindling down into the black abyss of the Atlantic Ocean.  I don't understand the point of keeping a priceless diamond for about eighty years just to plop into the ocean.  Maybe her senility clouded the fact that its value is beyond that of money, or maybe she just an IDIOT!  Uh-oh, it appears that now I am nitpicking.

Now that I have had time to step back and organize my opinions objectively, I can no longer claim that ""Titanic"" is the worst movie in history.  Though there are a number of places where the dialogue is unforgivable, and the performances of DiCaprio and Zane are downright laughable, I must admit that the cinematography is superb, as are the directing and the special effects.  I find it horrible that the lives of some 1100 people or so are trivialized by focusing on the clichéd love story between the two lead.  I can't, however, in clear conscience, continue to condemn this movie as I have in the past.  Glistening amongst the arrid wasteland of poor dialogue are gems of writing (though most of them are factual occurrences that not even James Cameron would dare claim to be his ideas) and visual communication.

In this film, you don't connect so much with the characters but you can see how the characters connect with each other which is something else entirely. If these people who were insulting this movie were to sit down in a theatre and watch it alone, i am sure that they would love it, hell these people were the ones that were raving about it in 97! The special effects are like nothing seen before on film. They are amazing, for the time the special effects were very ahead of its time and even now to this day, the effects are just as good.

The director even stages a gun battle in the middle of the sinking, as if one of the most dramatic events in the 20th century needed another cliffhanger.

The colors simply looked beautiful and bright and the change between blue and red intensified the drama and viewers' emotions very effectively. The ""I'm flying"" scene at the bow worked as if you were actually there, with seawater going by underneath your vision.

8 November 2004,becks-17,10," Many flaws but still magical
","OK, I have a confession:I was one of the fourteen year old girls who sobbed through many a viewing of Titanic,paid to see it at the cinema more than once, bought the video the day it came out and spent many evenings re-watching it. I read books about the film and about the actual history of the ship. In short I became obsessed. Sadly, or rather thankfully, I was not alone. Looking back now at the ripe old age of twenty I cringe at the memory of those days and although having only watched the film once in the last four years (truly) I still regard the film with affection. Of course, now I have distance to actually pick holes in it. Yes, the writing in places is slightly glossy, shall we say. The story is rather predictable and the whole rich girl falls in love with poor cheeky chappy has been done a few times before. The run up to the sinking takes one and a half hours and the sinking takes that time again. Some would say it moves too slowly and for the action loving film-goers out there I certainly take their point. The film does tend to take stereotypes to the max (for instance the treatment of third-class passengers and the snobbery of first-class). This said, I was not alive in 1912 and perhaps this is a completely justified representation of how things were! To me, (though I would never have admitted this six years ago) the iceberg never looked very real-again, having not seen many big icebergs I may be mistaken. However the film has something very rare. It has a certain kind of magic, a soul to it that makes fourteen year old girls sob into their pillows after watching it-I never actually did that...it was just an example.. The love story, although predictable and almost sickening in places has an innocent quality, awakening in the audience memories of their first loves and the naughty glances across rooms and boat decks. True, this is not Leonardo DiCaprio's finest hour (anyone who has seen him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" will testify) but then the story does not demand an awesome display of acting qualities-just that he be life-loving with a boyish charm (and be able to hang onto the side of a ship for long stretches of time). Kate Winslet plays the sheltered high-society darling to perfection and the rest of the cast slot into place. Of course, the real lead character is the 'Ship of Dreams' herself and the art department certainly came up trumps there, as did the special effects team, turning the cinema/TV screen into a porthole peering into the past-except for the aforementioned iceberg (but then that always posed a problem)-the whole film makes 1912 come alive for a modern-day audience.",/review/rw0959061/?ref_=tt_urv

One of the main problems seems to be that Cameron brought a fictional story to the Titanic rather than one of the real ones.  Yes, but then you can say that about most war movies- or books, for that matter!  I don't think the real people of the Titanic were ignored at all.  We got to see the different classes and ways of life in a combined story.  Or people say he didn't spend enough time on Molly Brown's character- but how long do you all want this movie to be?!  If I was going to complain about anything, I might mention that the second class seems to have disappeared from the ship.  But again, the movie is already over three hours long. I know that feeling when you seem to be the only one to know about something or someone and then it becomes ""household"".  I've always been incredibly interested in Titanic and knew all those random but real stories that all 9th grade girls now know.  I have loved Kate Winslet since Heavenly Creatures was made and Leo since I saw him in Basketball Diaries.  Remember when no-one knew who either of them were?  But this really doesn't matter. My point is let something be popular without feeling abliged to stand out and hate it.  Just because it is mainstream doesn't mean it is bad.",/review/rw0436427/?ref_=tt_urv

But of course we cannot deny that the ship is doomed in 4 days and 1500 people are going to die. The sinking of the ship and the death of the passengers is not easy to watch but it is part of what made the film a great epic. The final scene where Rose's spirit goes back to Titanic on the ocean floor and joining Jack and other spirits is powerful and moving. The love between Jack and Rose none of us can ignore and feel.

My thirteen-year old sister could have come up with that plot.  In addition, it was approximately 17 hours long.

","When I first saw this movie a year ago, I was looking foward to an OK movie-nothing special, but you know-what the hell.  The theaters were packed full-all 3 showing the movie, that is.  When the music, and the footage of the ship leaving dock first started, my heart already ached because I knew the ship was the culmination of the world's optimism.  I also knew that it would sink, killing 1500 people.  What a lesson in human arrogance and stupidity.  Though the sinking of the ship was indeed sad, it is the characters that make the story absolutely heart-rending.  The story of Rose and Jack, two star-crossed lovers; Andrews, guilt-ridden that he hasn't built a stronger ship; Unsinkable Molly Brown; a mother who is saddened by what her daughter is forced to do, but ultimately goes along with it; the craven Bruce Ismay; villains Caledon Hockely and valet/henchman Spicer Lovejoy...the list continues. The technical prowess of Cameron cannot be overlooked.  The special effects were astounding, especially when the ship starts sinking and you get the full impact of the size of the ship and the horror the passengers must have felt when they realized that the unsinkable ship was turning into a steel tomb.  The music was perfect.  I can't say any more.  If you haven't seen it, you'll know what I mean when you see it.  And if you have seen it, you already know what I'm talking about.  And at the end...whoo boy.  I didn't have nearly enough Kleenex.  I think my sister was the only dry-eyed one there.  There were times when I couldn't hear over the viewers snuffling.

It seems so real and is very very moving.The first time i saw it i cried (which i hardly ever do in a movie)Jack and Rose are perfect together and it is very sad at the end when Jack dies. The whole movie taught me a lot. I was very glad i watched it for my first time when i was 11 years old now i am 13 and have watched it 6 times since then. And i never seem to get bored of it it is a one of a kind movie and i can see why it won so many Oscars. I really like the scene were Rose and Jack are at the front of the boat and jack says ""do u trust me"" then he lifts her up so 'shes flying'.The whole movie i rate 10/10 for obvious reasons.",/review/rw0985886/?ref_=tt_urv

","I just saw the movie not too long ago from start to finish with my boyfriend. He thought it was really stupid but I loved it. It was beautiful, Especially the true love moments between Rose and Jack. Rose is a sad girl before Jack not really living life, just doing whatever she was told. Engaged to a guy she did not love, well that changed when she met Jack. Rose was unhappy with her life, so she was going to jump into the water, but Jack convinced her of otherwise. From there the movie becomes better and better. The only part that really made me cry, was when the workers wouldn't let the people from 3rd class out. Well there is a mother and her two children and she tells them a story to help them sleep, knowing them would never wake up again. I love the character Rose, for not getting into the boat even when everyone wanted her too, she choose to stay with Jack till the end.

","Of course this is a chick flick and of course not everyone's going to appreciate it, but seriously, if you take a good look at it, it's a wonderful film.  I loved it the first time I saw it, and I still do.  Now, I don't cry at movies and I'll be the first one to say if a movie really stinks, but TITANIC was a perfect movie.  There were a few problems like...well, if they're standing in water chest-high and things are electrically shorting out, then why are they still alive?  and when she hit that guy while she was looking for the key to the cuffs, before he even touched his face he had blood all over his hand.  and when everyone was outside starting to get into the lifeboats, why couldn't you see anyone's breath?  It was just as cold then as it was when they were all in the water! But, despite these things, TITANIC got all that it deserved.  It was everything people want to see in a movie.  Personally, I think that at times the whole love story was a little drawn out, but it's not the love story that makes the movie this time.  It's an endless tale of the perils on the biggest ship in the world.  Just because there's some kiddy love in the story doesn't mean that it's an all-around chick flick.  If you think that, then you need to get a clue.  If you didn't see the to-the-detailed accounts of things that really happened, or take the movie for what it was, then of course, you're not going to appreciate it.  But, TITANIC was more than just a documentary, it was a wonderful portrayal of what really DID happen on the Titanic.  And I'm sure somewhere along the lines on the ship a boy and girl fell in love and were torn apart by death.  It's not as unrealistic as you may think.  Just stop and take in the horror of the sinking and the detailed account of the times and what it would have been like to be a third class person and know that you haven't even a chance to live.  And if you still don't like the film or appreciate what it's about, get over it.  Until you take in the whole picture, you have no right to bash it.

I couldn't find a bigger reason to why this film was made because it was a big budget production with very little acting talent in it. I think Leonardo DiCaprio was better off playing the leading man in a film that didn't consist of him playing some bum who falls in love with the rich girl role. He's got much more talent for other acting genres than this movie. I didn't find much going on with his leading lady Kate Winslet because she sounded very plain since giving it was a periodical piece. I loved the costumes, but some of the acting was not properly matched for the caliber of the film.",/review/rw0437844/?ref_=tt_urv
1 December 2002,JediMasterMo2,," Good film, but WAY too overrated
","Titanic is definitely a great movie. Incredible visual/sound effects, fantastic directing, art direction, costumes, etc. However, for this movie to win ELEVEN oscars and be the top-grossing movie in history??? I think that's crap!!! This wasn't THAT good. First of all, the movie had terrible dialogue. Kate Winslet overracted badly and said her lines so unbelievably annoying. The movie was also way too sappy and corny. I know it's a love story, but if you're going to make a movie that you know is going to be an international hit, then you should make it so it appeals to ALL audiences. I like the fact that the movie was a mix of all genres, though. It had its romance, humor, drama, etc. It even had its thriller/suspense effect around the last hour. But, the movie could've been a whole lot better. It got way too much acclaim than it deserved. All in all, I think that Titanic is great, but not excellent. It deserved its share of oscars, but not the amount it got. It deserved to be really successful at the box office, but definitely not the highest-grossing ever. I recommend it to everybody, but I wouldn't expect an unbelievable, perfect, too-good-to-be-true film like it's been displayed to be. Thank you! 7.5/10 stars",/review/rw0437570/?ref_=tt_urv

","A `Titan' of a Movie History does provide Hollywood with some of the best story lines. The story of the tragic sinking of the so-called `Ship of Dreams', the infamous Titanic, has touched people's hearts throughout the century. This is a perfect plot for a fantastic movie. Thanks to a little Hollywood magic, we can experience for ourselves the horror and drama of the fateful ocean journey of the Titanic. Titanic is one of the great movies of the last decade. It was a success from the time it hit cinemas, amazing audiences around the world. And why wouldn't it? This marvelous movie has great actors, an incredible set and costumes, and, of course, a historically accurate plot, that is going to be remembered for years to come. In addition to telling of the fate of the Titanic, this movie also captivates audiences with the dramatic love story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), two passengers aboard the `unsinkable' ship. DiCaprio plays a poor third class passenger who falls in love with the beautiful, but engaged, first class passenger, Winslet. Between chases and dramatic rescue acts, these two actors awe audiences with their charm and tenderness in the many love scenes. One of the most famous scenes of the movie, the parting of the two lovers after the sinking of the Titanic, is guaranteed to make hearts wrench and eyes shed tears. But this is not the only scene that truly moves viewers. Though the general theme of the movie, the sinking of the Titanic, is often ignored due to the captivating acting, it is, after all, what makes the movie special. The sinking was tragic, but what was really touching were the different scenes of the passengers of the Titanic right before it sank. James Cameron didn't skip anyone. He shows us all the people that are mentioned in history books, including Mr. Guggenheim and Mr. and Mrs. Strauss. These people's last moments on earth are almost as dramatic than those of the two lovers, Jack and Rose. From an historical point of view, all classes aboard the ship are represented with attention to detail, such as costume, dialogue, and their particular activities. Of course the costumes of the first class passengers are heavenly. They represent the style of 1912 perfectly, including the accessories such as hats, purses, cigarettes (which make many appearances throughout the movie), and jewelry. But the third class is also represented well, through costume but mainly through acting. There are many `foreigners' in these classes, just like 91 years ago on the Titanic. Small details and scenes in the movie make it so memorable. The saddest part, according to my own opinion, is the faithfulness of the musicians, who continued playing their instruments while chaos and panic erupted around them. The movie, however, would not have been such a great success without the incredible set. Throughout the entire movie you never get the feeling that the ship was not the actual Titanic sailing the Atlantic Ocean. Not only does the ship itself seem to be authentic, but also all the accessories such as chairs, china, beds, and more. Even the famous grand staircase is recreated to look like the original. The audience is bound to feel like they are dining and sharing in the lives of people of the 1910's.",/review/rw0437659/?ref_=tt_urv

","For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated with the story of the Titanic. When I was a child I watched everything I could from TV documentaries to repeats of ""A Night to Remember"". I remember the excitement I felt when they finally found the sunken ship that had been missing for over 70 years. So, when I saw the first previews of James Cameron's movie about the Titanic in 1997, I was very interested in seeing it. That was until I heard that it was going to be a love story. Once I heard that, I was split on whether or not I wanted to see it. However, after reading more about the movie and the detail that was put into recreating the events of that fateful night, my interest was renewed. Cameron did an excellent job of blending a fictional story, albeit a love story, with the actual stories of the Titanic. His accurate use of facts such as a woman over hearing Ismay suggesting to the captain to light the last boilers. In that seen you can see a woman seated behind the two as she hears him tell the captain this. Another, is the story of the chef who survived the sinking. It is a well known fact that he was intoxicated at the time of the sinking, and that witnesses say that he stayed on the ship until the very end. But more importantly, I believe that through the use of a love story that connects with the viewer, Cameron was able to tell the story of all the lives that where lost that night and the pain that they must have felt. I know the movie made an impact on me, and not because of the love story, but because for the first time I saw the true story of the loss of life that happened that night.",/review/rw2381540/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is one of the most popular, well known romance movies. It was, at one point, the highest grossing film of all time. However for the life of me, don't get the hype. I mean story wise it's nearly identical to thousands of other romantic dramas that have been done before, been done after, and in honesty, have been done much better! It's the typical woman falls in love with guy who's of different status (in this case he's poor and she's rich), and of course her parents disapprove (geez, haven't heard that one before). The problem isn't that it's a story that's been done before (after all every movie takes inspiration from some previous work in some way, and if you can add a new spin on something it can feel fresh), but the problem is that this movie feels very generic and done to death, outside of the whole ""takes place during one of the most horrible disasters in history"" angle, the story is as basic as they get, they don't add anything new or unique with it, or deconstruct the genre, they play the tropes 100% straight, and the dialog really cheesy and not the best written, I calculated, jack and rose say each others name 162 times throughout the film, and this isn't a nitpick, I noticed the first time I watched, it feels so unnatural, I mean think about it! Do you say the name of the person your talking to that much while having a conversation? The rest of the script isn't well written either, I mean case in point: what full grown adult woman would say ""I'm flying"" when on the tip of the ship like a little girl while sober? Another dumb part would have to be when their on the bow of the ship while it's sinking Rose says ""this is where we first met"" really? The ship is sinking, now's not a good time for that!

","Personally, I loved this movie. I am only 13 years old so obviously wasn't able to see it when it came out in cinemas! I first saw Titanic the movie when I was about 10 or 11 years old and I'll tell you now, I absolutely loved it then, and nothing has changed over the years! When I was about 10 I had this major crush on Leonardo DiCaprio and so I mainly watched it the first time to see him! But, as I watched it, I was so moved and I appreciated it for more than just a hot guy! I loved the parts that you just remember no matter how long it's been since you last saw the movie, like when Jack saves Rose from committing suicide, when they ""fly"" on the bow of the boat, when Jack draws Rose nude on the couch, when the ship gets hit by the ice berg and people are playing with the ice, when that woman sings her children to sleep because she recognizes that their fate is death.. the list goes on! The movie, while parts are not strictly accurate, is mostly accurate. Obviously, some characters such as Jack and Rose were fictional people made up as icing on the cake, but there were some people who actually did board that ship such as Mr. Bruce Ismay, Captain Smith, Mr. John Jacob Aster and several others. However, what really gets me is why a man who is actually said to have acted heroically was portrayed as he was, shooting a passenger and then swallowing his gun! All of you who have seen this movie know exactly who I'm talking about. That was another part that you can't forget no matter how long ago you last saw this movie.",/review/rw1071181/?ref_=tt_urv

Only some of the crew survived. On the one hand I think that the theme is good and very interesting as it is based on a real event, but on the other hand in my opinion it's too long and it can be boring. But if you like this type of film you will enjoy it all the time. In 1h 18m a servant from Rose is brushing her hair while they are talking, and this moment is very tedious.

Titanic was a very good representation of what actually happened, except for the whole Jack and Rose story, but you get the point. I loved the movie for a few reasons. The first being because of the accuracy. The second being because it revitalized interest in the ship, and the third being that I loved the color shots of the ship, as opposed to actual pictures of the ship which are all in black and white. I have taken a still from the movie, of the ship, and set it as my computer's background because I just love that shot, (it is the shot of the ship shortly after it has left Southampton where the camera moves in on the ship starting from a long distance and then getting progressively closer until it finally hovers over the bridge and you see Captain Smith say ""lets stretch her legs"") I love that shot, and the movie that it was in. I feel that people were beginning to forget about the Titanic and when the movie came around people began to be reminded about it and started to gain an interest in it again.

","Movie review Titanic is in my opinion an amazing movie. It exposes the true definition of love. Leonardo DiCario fearlessly takes on the leading role as Jack Dawson and in the end sacrifices his life for the woman he falls in love with. Titanic captivates the audience using agape love to connect with the audience and exciting real life situations for the audience to relate to. This movie shows Loves greatest attributes. Those attributes being sacrifice, youth, beauty, humbleness, and endlessness. The beginning of the movie allows the audience to get to know and understand the characters that play significant parts in the movie. Jack and Rose are casted as the leading actors and do a tremendous job in delivering the directors message with their skills. Yet, there are a few other important people that play imperative parts as well. Victor Garber (who plays Thomas Andrew), acts as the captain of the ship. He brilliantly portrays himself to be a dedicated, hardworking man that is emotionally connected to his ship as it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The director sets the movie up chronologically but reverts to everything as a flashback, which is creative genius. Bernardo Bertolucci is the director of the film and directs this movie in such a way that the world now has a romantic novelty that can be used to show what true love looks like between a man and a woman throughout history, as well as defining true artistic and creative ideas that will forever have an effect of the audience that watches it. Leonardo DiCario and Kate Winslet (who plays rose Dewitt Bukater) have so much chemistry on the screen. The way those two connect is as if they have been passionately in love before in a past life. The climax of the movie is without a doubt the sinking of ship. From the time the ship hits the iceberg, until the time Jack drifts off to sea, action overtakes the movie and real life thrill pops out of the screen. As far as the directing during these scenes, the angles in which the camera records are very effective and essential to the overall perception of the movie. The way the camera zooms in behind and around Rose and Jack as they do the balcony scene, allows the audience to experience that very moment as well and examine how Rose and Jack's bodies reacted to each other the moment he knew he had fallen in love with her. The ending of the movie is where the audience pushes to the edge of their seats and grabs their tissues and the arm of whomever they came with. After seeing Jack sacrifice his life for the one person in the world he found to love more than anything, brings tears to even the men who watch. This is one of the most heartfelt profound films I've ever seen. It's jam packed with emotion, love, experience, knowledge, wisdom, hope, and action. That is the reason this movie is still a phenomenal hit in 2013. The Titanic is truly cinematic genius and is in my opinion one of the top three Romance movies of our time.",/review/rw2898306/?ref_=tt_urv
28 October 1998,Capt.,," Which mood are you in?
","Titanic(1997) is -by popular consensus -an impressive film, though in many different ways to different people.  The budget, effects, script and emotional content have all been praised and attacked ad-nauseum, but I believe that the film has very strong merits and is at least as good as any other movie which is so hyped.  On first viewing, when prepared for a spectacle, Titanic delivers (and how) and when you're watching in a sympathetic mood the tradgedy can truly strike home.  If you watch it in a mood to be stimulted you will likely be disappointed as it doe not have the crisp dialogue of As Good As It Gets, or the integrity of Dances with Wolves.  Titanic is a brilliant film when watched in its element, but does not operate on multiple levels; either you admire the technical/historical creation or the (increasingly with repeat viewing) shallow love affair. I am a fan, but having seen it now some 10 times, some parts are less than entertaining, and altough it remains a strong favourite I must recognise the flaws and shallow nature of the script.

","Titanic is one of the most popular movie. When you watch this movie for the first time, you are probably going to be sad. It's been created in a wonderful way and I'm sure that if James Cameron has the same equipment that helped him to create Avatar, he would have created this movie in an incredible way. The only weak spot is James had not given a space to talk about other people who had died in that disaster. He had concentrated on Rose and Jack. In my opinion, if he did not do that mistake, this movie was going to be better than The Shawshank Redemption which is the best movie. I want to talk about the music. It was really awesome and what made it like this because he chose one of the best composers who is James Horner. Another strong point was its plot.

20 September 2005,zingzangspillip,7," Good movie
","This is an odd film. It takes an historical disaster, the sinking of the Titanic and it adds a saccharine love story on top that supposedly makes the film more accessible. First, let's talk design. James Cameron and his crew have really outdone themselves here. The Oscars and other awards won for these categories were deserved. The promenade set is a sight to behold, and when we finally get to see the ship sink, we see an amalgam of miniatures and computer effects put one of the 20th century's worst disasters indelibly on film. The way Cameron influences our emotions with secondary characters is very well done. We see flashes of families in the third class who know they are going to die soon. Old couples, families with small children. Seeing them is truly heartbreaking, and it is for those people that I mourn when I think of the Titanic. However, instead of letting these images tell the story, Cameron has included a love story on top to make the movie more palatable to audiences. To me, this is the only weakness of the film. The acting is fine (Kathy Bates is brilliant as Unsinkable Molly Brown), but since the main storyline is the weakness of the film, this creates a problem. The fact the relationship was extra-marital didn't help proceedings.",/review/rw1176878/?ref_=tt_urv

The movie starts a little slow, but then at some point you are drawn in and the characters become real, and the terror they face becomes real. By the end, when Rose dies and meets Jack on the staircase and everyone cheers it is impossible not to feel sad. This movie could had been horrible but it pulls it off. It was a real risk to make and it worked wonderfully. The reason this movie works is hard to describe. Maybe it's the slow beginning that does it. We start to forget that this ship is destine to sink and just watch what is on screen.

Titanic is a tale of love and disaster all in one. The irony of it is that Rose saw Titanic as a ""slave ship"", yet she found Jack who allowed her to break free and pursue her dreams. Finding Jack on the ship changed Rose's life; she did all of the things that Jack and her had talked about doing, which she probably would not have done if she hadn't of met him. This movie shows that those that you have loved do live on inside of you forever, and Rose lived on for both herself and Jack. Doing for both of them what they had only talked about doing.

29 August 2005,oxmiaxo,10," I first went to see this movie when i was eight years.....
","I first went to see this movie when i was eight years old. Because i was young i did not get the concept of the movie, therefore i did not fall in love with the characters as i did when i got older. The characters are Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor man who won two tickets on Titanic by having a luckily hand in poker. His friend Fabrizio, an Italian man, accompanies him. During the trip Jack saves a woman named Rose(Kate Winslet), who was attempting suicide. As a reward Rose's fiancé, Cal, invites Jack to dinner along with them and the first class. During the next day, Rose gets to know this man who saved her, and she finds to love him, and not her fiancé. Towards the ending, when the ship is sinking, Rose must choose between her rich fiancé Cal, or the man she loves, Jack. Although this may seem as a sappy love story, it is still really about the ""unsinkable"" ship Tianic. Titanic, the ship and its passengers has been one of the most intriguing things that I've ever studied. as the ship is sinking they only let women and children on to the lifeboats first, but then they do not let out the people 3rd class, and you see a woman telling her children a bedtime story, because she knows that there is just no hope of surviving. This movie will make your eyes water, if the least. Its a long, but very good movie. i have seen it about 6 or 7 times and i still cry every time. James Cameron has done a great job on this movie. without the music, and the actors, this movie wouldn't of been the same.",/review/rw1161110/?ref_=tt_urv

Everything, from the wallpaper in the 1st Class Suites to the bunks in 3rd Class, from the bow where Jack and Rose have their first meeting to the wireless room where Harold Bride and Jack Phillips desperately sent their (ultimately futile) SOS signals for emergency assistance, is, as it were, ""as it was."" Cameron even ensures that the audience is never in doubt as to the horrific fate of the 1500 people left aboard Titanic when the lifeboats left; there was no absence of life jackets, and most of the people left behind froze to death in the icy waters off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. For most Americans born after the discovery of the Titanic's wreck by Robert Ballard in 1986, this film was their introduction to the fascinating, tragic story of the ""unsinkable"" ship of dreams.

","I love the movie Titanic! But it's really sad, but i think it's kinda predictable. Cause you can tell Jack and Rose will get together and that Jack will die, right from the start. But it made a couple of mistakes, i mean they didn't have flashlights like what they have in it back in 1912. And the lights in the ship should have turned of earlier, cause they had no back up power and stuff like that then. but i think it's so sad cause you know that only a few people will live, you know that all the poor will die.

I have to say that I found it sadly lacking. It was a historically inaccurate movie about a girl that cheats on her fiancee. I find it sickening that the American people find such great pleasure in a movie like this. There was no action at all in the first 2 or so hours of the film; Leonardo stood around and looked cute and Kate stood around and tried to look cuter. The ""evil"" character in this movie was completely one dimensional showing us no other qualities of himself except that of some ogre which makes you wonder why Kates character ever got engaged to him anyway. When her romance with Leonardo began she never before, during, or after suggested to the Ogre that they should ""just be friends"" she decided just to skip that and start steaming up some windows. And why did people see it so many times? Did they expect the ending to change after the eleventh viewing? Were they hoping to see the boat not sink? I think it could have been a wonderful movie if they had based it more on fact such as ""Gettysburg"" or ""Braveheart"". The true story of the Titanic is filled with action and sorrow and loss enough that they didn't need to ruin it with a revolting play of a Cheater, an Ogre, and a Pretty Boy that brought excitment to an otherwise boring and uneventful voyage.",/review/rw0436834/?ref_=tt_urv

10 April 2012,riddhiman-mukherjee-292-625680,9," Titanic 3D (2012)- Absolute nostalgia !!!
","First of all, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia, when I learned that Titanic(1997) is returning to theatres! It is a favourite movie of mine, hearkening back to those years when I was a relatively young, unspoilt kid. who had no idea what the 'Big Bad World' was like( I was an 11 year old boy when 'Titanic' was released on 'March 1998' here in India). I had went to see Titanic being impressed by the huge ship, the story . My father had booked tickets at Globe Cinema Hall(Esplanade Kolkata- now closed)a week beforehand. But my mother, learning about ""certain"" scenes , persuaded my father to return the tickets. But as desperate I was back then to see the film,I had quietly removed the tickets from his Office- Bag and hid it. When He learned of it, instead of scolding me, he decided to keep the tickets. I remember feeling extremely awkward during the painting and the car scene, trying to hide my eyes, and still daring to peer through my fingers. But Titanic moved me, totally. It was a wonderful Romantic film, and the power of love and the inevitable tragedy had brought tears to my 11 year old self back then. And oh, the music! I remember when the movie had finished and the credits started rolling with the famous song, everyone was exiting the theatre. I was stuck there , with tears frozen in my cheeks, unable to move, unwilling to leave. I felt so lost so saddened. The tag line really hit home for me- "" Nothing on Earth could come between them"" Some of my friends have found the movie to be nothing more than a disaster picture, some have found it to be a moving love story that is universal. Watching the 3D version was reliving those memories! It wasn't as affecting as it was back in '98 but it was surely nostalgic. The 3D post-conversion was brilliant, I mean really good, But I imagine it to look no less better in its original 2D version. Though the 3D was never distracting, it felt almost as good as that of 'Avatar'.Depth was stunning! And the newly 4K restored print sparkled with fine details. But now my BIG complaint- (""SPOILER AHEAD"") - The nude-sketching scene of Rose, was unjustly, and badly censored. any instances of Kate Winslets Breast or lower torso was removed, zoomed-in, pan-scanned. Even the kiss, after Rose says thank you and takes the painting was cut. It totally put me off. I lost my interest in watching the movie. They raped the artistic integrity of the movie, right there! It was such a beautiful and sweet scene. I read reports that the censor board of India passed the film uncut, hence I was shocked to see such abominable censoring. But then this is not just India, this is a part of India- The state of West Bengal, and anything can happen here.Is a Woman's body still an object of shame???

","It is easy to see why Titanic won so many Academy Awards. The special effects are incredible! I watched the movie on the TCM channel last week quite by accident. I had told myself that I would probably never see it because teen girls were seeing it a dozen times, and that made me a bit suspicious. I asked my wife if she had ever seen it. She said, like me, she had seen it on TV. My friends tell me that it is best seen in a big screen theater, but it is too late for that. Also, it is getting harder and harder to find big screen theaters. My wife, a reader, told me that it was not much of a movie. Her definition of a movie is one that fully develops the characters, and in the case of Titanic, the movie was just a vehicle for a love story between Leonardo and Kate. I was told that you could see the plot coming down the pike, and you could. I asked if it was not also the role of a movie just to entertain and was told that that is not enough. In thinking about what I was told I could appreciate that Titanic was not a great movie, but it was sure entertaining and jaw dropping, and I am not just talking about the sketching scene.",/review/rw2322731/?ref_=tt_urv

","Truth? I did not see Titanic first run. Admittedly I was turned off by all the hype. Everyone was talking about it and how many times they had seen it. And I could not go anywhere without hearing Celine Dion. *lol* I finally gave in to curiosity and watched Titanic on it's first video release. I fell in love with it. So I mostly just shake my head and chuckle. People still come here to bash this film. It has had loyal fans for the better part of a decade. Out of all the films in IMDb, some of which truly are bad, why not go to those boards? Why do people keep coming here to bash not the film as much as it's' fans? It is very perplexing and a little amusing. Are they hoping to change the minds of loyal fans? Do they also go to the boards of Gone with the Wind? The Wizard of Oz? Star Wars? Harry Potter? Lord of the Rings? Fans of these films also have all Collector's Editions and vast collections of memorabilia. Film makers will create what they think will sell but ultimately, it is we, the fans of film that decide. There are many really wonderful films that are not big money makers. This does not mean that a top grossing film is not good. At the core of this film is the importance of the Historical event. Human ego and arrogance will always be our downfall as a species. When we begin to see ourselves as untouchable and invincible, the result is always tragic. Yes there is a love story painted all over the surface of this film. Cameron even admits that this is as a technique to pull the viewer in. It is the ship that is the star (no pun intended), of this story. He had a burning passion to tell her story. Harry Potter has 3rd graders lined up around the block to read a novel! True fans more proudly announce how many times they have read the books as much as seeing the films. Now while Harry Potter is obviously not based on historical events, J. K. Rowling pulls in elements from classic literature and mythology. Shindler's List is extremely important, both historically and cinematically. It brought renewed attention to historical events that we should never forget. History only repeats if we don't learn the lesson the first time. Whether or not a film personally appeals to me, I respect any cinematic work that gets people reading, talking, thinking about things that they wouldn't normally. Who cares if some fans are wrapped in the love story. Cameron accomplished his goal. People will not forget. Love it or hate it I have yet to meet anyone lukewarm about this film. Love and hate are both passions. This film inspires passion. If someone is going to come here to post about what they didn't like about this film then please do so. Let's hear what you didn't like, let's hear a critique.

Any dumb ass with a little common of understanding how Buoyancy force works will tell how it could've not been possible for that piece of debris to take them both regarding weight. It was even showed in the movie, Jack tried to get on the wooden thing but it sunk, not to mention how Rose was such a decent person through out the movie, she freaking blew my mind, firstly choosing real love instead of money and going back for jack in the freaking middle of a catastrophe surrounded by water and then refusing to jump in a rescue boat with women and children and stupidly stayed for him. Oh well closing off this stupid Facebook argument, i have to say that the acting in this movie was stellar. Everything was on point, each character was unique on his own way and of course DiCaprio never cease to impress me especially in this movie. He did it perfectly by portraying a poor likable person with huge confidence and that showed during the scene of the dinner when he sat with bunch of rich highly regarded people and shut them up with his views of how to live your life, a scene that left my jaw opened. Not to mention, i was blown away by the graphics and camera work of the massive ship going down. The only thing that made made give this masterpiece a 9 out of 10 is because how selfish their love story seemed in the middle of such a disaster they only seemed to care for each other.

","The Titanic is a movie reenacting the historical event of a ship that was heading towards America and hit an iceberg and sank. In the movie, one of the main characters, Rose, is narrating and telling her point of view of what happened on the Titanic almost 80 years before. Rose was a young, upper class woman on the ship with her aristocratic family. On the ship, she soon meets a lower-class man named Jack Dawson. They met when Rose was considering jumping of the ship and he had no choice but to save her if she did. He ends up talking her down and that begins their relationship. They had many other encounters together where he was in her world, and she was in his. Throughout their many events together, they soon realize they are in love and they cannot spend the rest of their lives together without each other. This dream soon comes to a halt whenever the ship hits an unexpected iceberg. At first it just felt like a bump, but then slowly the ship started to fill up with water and begin the sink, and the chaos became greater as everyone tried to get off the ship or to safety. There were rescue boats on the ship, but the amount of extra boats compared to the amount of people was extremely different. The first people allowed on the safety boat were woman and children, but in reality it was the upper class people who got to get to safety first while the lower class passengers were still stuck in the lower deck of the boat. Rose refuses to leave Jack, so she stays on the ship with him, all the way until it plunges into the ice cold water. Rose finds a piece of wood to lie on while Jack swam beside her in the water. More rescue ships came, but it was already too late for Jack. Rose was on of the few survivors after the ship completely sunk and was able to tell her story to anyone who would listen. In the movie, special effects had to be used to make the ship sink. The quality of special effects used made the sinking ship in the movie look like what was described to happen in the actual historical event.",/review/rw2880738/?ref_=tt_urv

This movie is incredible, I've loved it in every way - the scenes, the script, the picture, the clothes, the music - it's all so magical. I really enjoyed watching 'Titanic'. The actors are amazing - handsome Leo and beautiful Kate (which is by the way one of my favorite actresses) did fine job and I couldn't picture anyone else to act instead of them. There is some kind of power, some kind of joy which can be seen in every second of this movie and that is what makes it so great. Love between Rose and Jack is so amazingly expressed in that free, innocent way of their talking and just looking at each other. And I don't want you think that I'm one of those types who are pure romantic souls and instantly watch soaps. I'm in fact opposite of them, maybe not entirely, but I am. That's why I don't think Rose should be criticized for letting Jack go into the water. That is the thing that makes the strength of this movie, the freedom of expressing cruel reality of today's world. It can't everything go well and as the way we want it. I really loved the fact that movie did not end '..and they lived happily ever after..' And it would be stupid if it ended like that. This movie shows that you can at least once in a lifetime experience pure, true and free love that can lead you to the most secret places in your mind and 'you can be saved by that person in every possible way that one person can be saved', just as Rose has said.

6 May 2008,mike_MJ,6," barely hanging onto life
","James Cameron, as is well known, stood firm not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of Titanic begs the question - had he not been lauded, would he have kept it real anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Cameron was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of Roger Hargreave’s most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Oxford/Cambridge boat race with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, Titanic also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Cameron hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning sink-age-isms as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to Titanic expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, Titanic has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. Titanic comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but Titanic is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",/review/rw1869843/?ref_=tt_urv

Now James Horner has a Grammy to add to his collection of Golden Globes and Oscars for the beautiful music he created that moved us to tears.  Granted, Celine Dion wasn't doin' too terrible before her heart went on, but now she's polishing and putting up the multiple awards she's won for singing the (I know, overplayed) theme song we will never get out of our heads.  As for others in the film, Bill Paxton and his earring will always be remembered - it replaced those visions of flying cows we had in our heads.  And instead of a question mark, we view Billy Zane as ""the mean guy who tried to shoot Leo!""  Cameron braved ""cold waters"" to get that movie made and I'm sure glad he did.  It amazes me that here, in February 1999, over a year since the movie was released, they're still giving it awards.  Cameron may have said the wrong words on Oscar night, but he did a ""bang up"" job on what has been called one of the greatest movies of all time.

","Yeah, the movie was something! I think it was the best one ever made. The beginning of Titanic is my favorite. When Jack won the tickets and everything else it was just wonderful. I also like the parts when Rose and Jack talked...also in the beginning. It was funny. The part when Titanic sank...well tht was the longest part...about 1.5 hours...I think it was a little too long. I don't know. I did not really cry at all, but i was really sad. The very end of the movie was good too. Did Rose die at the end? I am not sure. I guess we'll never know. The movie all together was just great. Looked very realistic. Good job, Cameron. I think if we would have more of those kinds of movies it would be so much fun. I really don't know what to say...it's hard to explain what I feel about it. You just have to see it. Oh well i guess everyone already did, but if you did not where have you been?

When I finally saw the movie in the theaters, I was left speechless! That was the best movie I have seen. The ""Titanic"" is more of a fairytale, a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seats until the end of the movie. It was a movie that displays the social classes, the untroubled life of the low classes and the superficial life of the rich ones. A part of the movie was a love story between two young people, the rich and misunderstood girl played by Kate Winslet and the poor young man played by Leonardo DiCaprio. When destiny brought them together on the voyage of the Titanic, they faced many troubling events in order to pursue their prohibited love. Another factor that everyone should absolutely go see this ""Titanic"" is because of the platinum and Oscar winning soundtrack. It was simply wonderful, it sounded like an angel singing and it really helped when it was played during the sad moments in the movie.

","There can be no dispute; James Cameron's 1997 epic, Titanic, is the greatest film ever to meet the silver screen, or any other screen for that matter. Firstly, the film offers a brilliant screenplay which weaves a series of actual events together with pure fiction. Secondly, the cast is perfectly chosen, with Leo and Kate at the front to hold the plot together, to Billy Zane's Cal Hockley (whom we all came to hate), all the way down to Kathy Bates as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. And third, the tireless work of thousands of people, including the brilliant James Cameron, who wrote, directed, co-produced and co-edited the picture. The film's box-office speaks for itself, with over 1.8 billion dollars earned in under two years. Also, the Oscars tributed the achievement of the film by awarding it 14 nominations and 11 wins, the most nominations and wins ever for a single film. In conclusion, Titanic is a tremendous film.

7 March 2006,fahqmange,7," Why this movie is overrated
","This movie illustrates very effectively what is wrong with most of major American cinema in the past 15-20 years. It can be summed up this way: It is the triumph of spectacle or style over substance. Way, way, way too often, Hollywood relies on special effects, attractive actors and flashy clothes and explosions. It's not that Titanic is a bad movie by any stretch, but it's certainly not a great movie either. The primary flaw is in Director James Cameron's attempt to write the script. I agree with most of the critics I've read that Cameron has a great eye but a somewhat defective ear. The characters are clichéd, poorly written and in many cases the acting is quite sub-par. All of this goes unnoticed by most people of course because of the fact that most Americans don't read enough to know what good, realistic well-written dialog sounds like (not to mention the fact that character development is all but completely overlooked by most major studios these days so most people aren't routinely exposed to truly well-developed interesting characters). All this adds up to the fact that Titanic, while an entertaining and well-done picture, hardly qualifies as the best movie made in 1997 and definitely not one of the best ever as so many people would care to assert. I think that the provider of the overly praise-laden commentary displayed on IMDb for this movie should A) graduate from high school and remember that people who don't think this movie is superb are actually in the minority and B) watch a few more, older movies, particularly those made with great scripts--like The Godfather, Chinatown, The Usual Suspects, Casablanca, any Tarantino or Hitchcock movie--and those with some great actors--like Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, Laurence Olivier, Ed Norton, Cate Blanchett, Jimmy Stewart, Daniel Day Lewis and Angelica Huston. Let's stop relying on the box office and the lame Academy of Motion Pictures (who somehow felt that Braveheart, Shakespeare in Love and yes, Julia Roberts deserved Oscars) to tell us what is a quality product.",/review/rw1309244/?ref_=tt_urv

Titanic makes us experience tragedy in two ways. The tragic death of thousands of people losing their lives, but we also experience it in the way it affected Rose personally. It's been over 20 years since the film's debut, and it still holds up just as well and is an all-time classic but There are several dumb plot conveniences, though they are quickly overshadowed by the spectacle and powerful performances that ""Titanic"" brings along with it. This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen. The story is well, and the actual romance is done questionably but still makes enough sense. Overall, a great film that truly captures the horror of what occurred on the Titanic, providing several tear-jerking moments, especially towards the end. If director James Cameron had concentrated on his thesis that the sailing of the Titanic marked the transition from 19th Century ideas of classism to 20th Century notions of egalitarianism and had ignored the boring love story, this could have been a far more impactful feature. But it is not a bad movie. Does a good job with the romance. It's still a bit flighty there, but, I'd recommend it so that you can at least say, I've seen it. It has good performances. The story's just a bit cliche. Titanic is a movie that perhaps suffered from receiving too much positive critical attention. The dialogue is melodramatic and the characters sometimes make questionable decisions, but as a spectacle, the movie is very successful, with lavish sets and impressive set pieces.

There are some good performances and room in the story for some engaging character development. There are also great special effects and plenty of action scenes, to keep your pulse up.

25 December 2002,BethanyTedder,8," The biggest problem I found with the movie
","was that I was more interested in the historical aspect of what had happened to the Titanic since I was 10. The love story was not a factor to me in seeing the movie. But I could pick out with great clarity the historical errors such as the one between Robert Hitchens and Molly Brown in the lifeboat. There was no way that the Molly Brown that we knew would have sit down and not taken action on her own. Also, the last time we saw John Jacob Astor was near the grand stair case leading one to believe this is where he died. He was actually hit with the falling smoke stack that we saw hit a third class passenger. The number of musicians were cut down from 8 to 5 I believe it was. And the burning question in my mind is, ""Where was the Californian?"" that sat about 10 miles away and didn't do a thing to help these people. All I remember seeing was the rescuing ship, the ""Carpathia"". There is controversy to this day as to whether William Murdock committed suicide. And since his body was never found, we will never know. Also there is controversy as to whether any passengers that were out of hand were shot by him or anyone else. About the best I can say for the characters of Cal and Ruth were that they showed with great clarity the attitude of the first class passengers towards the lower class of people. But on the real Titanic, Jack Dawson would not have been allowed to roam the whole ship nor make several contacts with builder, Thomas Andrews. But I do have to say that they opening underwater shots of the sunken Titanic were great. As for Jack and Rose, I believe had James Cameron dug deep enough, he could have found a ship romance that he could have used for the movie and it be a real romance. Of course, it probably would not have crossed class lines.",/review/rw0437581/?ref_=tt_urv

However, as the weeks passed my interest on going to watch the movie increased. Finally, one day my family invited me to go see it, and I decided to go to the theater. The movie impressed me a lot, it was sincerely wonderful. I still remember the scene when Jack took Rose to the end of the ship, and she opened her arms, while a beautiful song played and the wind hit her hair. The fact that the romantic story developed from a historical event made the movie more interesting. The effects that portrayed the crash and sink of the Titanic ship were incredible. Finally, the end of the movie seemed as sad as it had to have been when thousands of people lost their lives when the ship sank in 1912.

","We had to do a project for my BCIS (a computer class) class at school and it involved coming here. I'd never actually looked at the All Time Top U.S movies but I knew Titanic still reigned supreme. Anyway, but I also noticed something. We only had to list through the top 30 movies on our project but over half of them were Adventure/Sci-Fi/Fantasy or whatever. I think there was only one other drama or romance besides this one. Yet so many people seem to hate this movie. Well then why did it gross 601 million? Because when it comes down to it, I think this movie shows the kind of love between Jack and Rose that we all wish we had, whether we admit or not. I can't even begin to describe how I feel about this movie. I just don't get how so many people can dislike it or make fun of it. One of my friends told me that when she went to see it in theaters when it came out a big man in front of her with a cowboy hat was crying by the end. Ok, so maybe this movie did receive a lot of hype and so did ""My Heart Will Go On"", but for obvious reasons. I think that this is the greatest movie that there will ever be and honestly I hope nothing else ever outgrosses it. And even though I love Celine I don't just love this movie because Celine sings in it. But then again I am a hopeless romantic which is probably why I love this movie so much. I just think so much love has escaped the world and with all the divorces and everything in the world I just think it is incredible to see people like Jack and Rose and couples like them today that love each other that much. It's almost scary but amazing that love like that can exist. Maybe Jack and Rose call each other's names ten million times throughout the movie but they love each other so much it hurts. I read an article once where a girl was like ""oh my god, I can't believe Rose would give a perfectly good seat on a lifeboat for Jack."" Personally, I think she totally missed the point. But anyway... that's just my theory. I really think Titanic broke records in the movie world because maybe it's hard to see sometimes, but love really does conquer all. I think people realized that in 1997 and hopefully they can realize it again, now.",/review/rw0437638/?ref_=tt_urv
25 June 2010,luvrokk,10," Couldn't Have Been Better:
","I'm just a fifteen year old with a large amount of study behind myself. I saw this movie at first when my dad purchased it in 1998 when I was three. When I grew up a little, I thought the acting was brilliant throughout. I was completely mesmerized by the film. When I was old enough to understand the movie and history behind Titanic, I took advantage of the opportunity to study it. I learned the true facts and I cannot get enough. The event has been the focus of study time outside of school for about seven years. This movie inspired me to go out and study the ship and time period in history... Yes it's a romantic tragedy, and Leonardo Dicaprio is quite attractive and Kate Winslet is so gorgeous, I'm jealous! But I don't think that they were the main part... Titanic, the disaster was the true focus in this film. If Cameron were to create a documentary, how many movie goers would he get to see Titanic? Not many... So throw in a heart-wrenching romance for crying out loud! It's Hollywood, everyone knows it won't be COMPLETELY factual, they're going to try to get as many movie goers as possible. The movie was so greatly recognized because its a perfect ratio of occasional humor, tension, thrilling race of survival, and the kind of love that everyone dreams of having (that ends in this life with Jack, but continues in Roses heart forever). On that note of love continuing forever in a person's heart, ""My Heart Will Go On"" is my number one favorite song ever. Celine has got the most wonderful voice I've ever heard and she was definitely right for the theme song of the most moving movie of all time. I live in a town that isn't too diverse, besides money. Here, you're wealthy or poor. Not too many in between... and the 1st and 3rd class attitudes toward each other don't differ much from in the movie and in my hometown. The part of Titanic that gets me besides the facts/history is courage in the face of danger (as said on the cover of most copies of Titanic). The bow scene when Rose lets herself go into Jack and ""soars into a night without fear"" (on the script) shows how quickly passengers and crew were taken by surprise, as they feared nothing on the most glorious ship in the world. The disaster of Titanic is something I view as a sign to not get too comfortable, to never challenge nature; Titanic justifies just this. Hitting back on the movie itself, Titanic couldn't have been better. Casting was amazing, effects were brilliant beyond belief, and the story is a winner. Honestly, if this movie weren't made, I would of recognized the study of Titanic as my first love; but it wouldn't have been stunted as quickly as it was after seeing the film. -Brilliant acting. -Great casting. -Amazing effects. -Tragedy/Romance. -A little history.

","Titanic is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It has something for everyone. There's Romance, Disaster, Art, History, and family all mixed together. I first saw this movie a few years ago when I was home alone on a Saturday night. I was looking through my movie shelf and saw Titanic. I had seen parts of it before and never thought much of it. However, do to my high level of boredom I figured I'd watch it. I thought ""Well, it is the highest grossing film of all time. Why not?"" I went into it not expecting much. I knew it would be decent, but I had no idea how blown away I would be. From the very start, I was sucked into it. The music played at the very beginning was so sad and breathtaking, that I knew this movie was going to bring me to tears. I was blown away at the sets. They looked so real and just like the real Titanic! The dresses Rose wore were so beautiful. I thought the acting was good. I have seen better, but it does do a justice. I loved Kate Winslet as rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack. They work so well together. The love story was unbelievably convincing. I thought Billy Zane portrayed his character perfectly. Last but not least, who could forget Kathy Bates as Molly Brown? She stole the show for me. Next, the music. The music is by far the most beautiful score I have ever heard. From the Irish Bagpipes, to Sissel's stunning vocals, you will be blown away. If you cannot already tell, I love this movie. The Romance was great, and it made me tear up, even before the ship hits the iceberg. So naturally, I was bawling when Jack died. Kate Winslet's acting at that part was the best of hers in the whole film. When she cried ""Jack, Jack! There's a boat! Jack!"" I just lost it. The sound of her voice told you that she just wanted to die. The one good thing in her life had gone, and she was devastated. It was very convincing. The sinking of the ship was great as well. I like how Cameron spent a good hour plus on the sinking. He did it slow, just like it should have been. I have no problem with this movie being over 3 hours. Many complain, but I think the movie would not be as good without that length. Cameron said himself he wanted to develop Jack and Rose's relationship before the sinking to show people that the ship was lively and magnificent in order to make the sinking more devastating. I never got bored throughout the film. It always keeps me entertained. Oh and one thing I need to clear up. Jack could not have fit on the floating door with Rose. If you watched closely, you will see that he tried to get on with her, but it tipped over. It couldn't hold their weight, so Jack was a gentleman and saved Rose's life over his. In addition, Rose was not literally promising she would ""never let go"" on Jack. She was talking about how she would never let go of the promise she made to Jack, which was to go on in her life, have children, and die an old lady warm in her bed. Overall, this movie is stunning and deserved all the awards it got. Don't let someone out there keep you from watching it because they say it's ""overrated"" or because ""Rose was a *****.

",tell me what your favorite dress is that rose wears... mine would certainly have to be the gorgeous dinner gown however i am also in love with the jump dress... they're both so impressive! in case you're a bit hazy about the dresses she wore let me refresh your memory 1.) pin striped suit at the begging (w/ brimmed hat) 2.) red beaded dress she wears when she attempts suicide 3.) the green/lace dress she wears when jack first sees her 4.) the silky blue dress she wears when she kissed jack at the end of the ship 5.) the red layered dinner gown 6.) the white and black one with the rose on the collar which i believe she wears when she is having tea alone w/ cal 7.) the flowing purple/pink dress she wears during the sinking of the ship,/review/rw1354914/?ref_=tt_urv
29 March 2006,oneblack_rose1,10," I LOVED it!
","When I first saw Titanic, I was amazed at how well it was done. The acting was perfect, the directing excellent, and the story-line was also good. Every time my family and I (my mom and I) go to rent movies, I ALWAYS try to rent Titanic. I think it's the best movie I've seen (besides Chronicles of Narnia). My grandparents have never seen this movie. I told them that they should rent it and watch it, because it was a very good movie. It was good. There was lots of drama, which I like. There was also romance woven into the story-line, which I also liked. I think that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Rose (Kate Winslet) made great leading people in the movie. They worked well together, and I was surprised. That's the reason why I give Titanic 10 out of 10. The acting, directing, and story-line are excellent. If you haven't seen Titanic yet, I encourage you to rent it and watch it. It's a great movie! 10 out of 10 for Titanic.",/review/rw1328596/?ref_=tt_urv
