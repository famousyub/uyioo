","I have watched Titanic how many times I don't know. Everytime I watch it, I still cry, laugh, smile, and feel. The story flows with tension throughout the movie; two actors' acting and chemistry need applaud; Sinking ship is realistically filmed; 'My Heart Will Go On' is perfect fit for Jack and Roses' love story and is timeless as well. All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

10 August 2001,Smells_Like_Cheese,10," Actually it got better for me
","Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack.

It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter.

","I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see.""

The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.

11 January 2015,CalRhys,," Haunting, Powerfully Resonant And Visually Stunning
","James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version.

9 August 1998,Rage-4,," bravo
","Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

Over the years,it has became somewhat fashionable to slag Titanic off,even if a great many of those people who did so were probably amongst those who made it such an enormous hit in the cinemas. Titanic is flawed,definitely,sometimes greatly so. However,it's also a tremendous achievement for it's director James Cameron.

The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On.

14 June 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!
","When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch.

","This movie truly broke my heart. Jack and Rose face great difficulties (her being an aristocrat and him poor) but they still continue to fight fo their love no matter what. We first see an old lady which we later on know is Rose. She sees on the TV the drawing of her that Jack had made when thenews was talking about the Titanic shipwreck. She then goes on to call the news and tell her story.84 years ago on April 10th 1912, 17 year old Rose is on board on the Titanic ship along with her mom, grandma, and fiance, Caledon, (all of who'm were nobelty/aristocrats). Rose feels helpessly trapped by her situation ( marrying her snobby fiancé, Caledon) and tries to commit suicide by hanging off the edge of the deck until she was rescued by Jack. Jack is then invited by Caledon to a dinner amongst the rich in return for his heroic action. He goes through the evening acting his best at being rich. Jack then takes Rose down to the third-classe's party, where they dance endlessly. Shockingly, one of CaLedon's spies had followed them and informed him of his fiance's sneaking around. Rose was intruiged by Jack's drawings and so she asks him to draw her nude wearing the diamond necklace Caledon gave her. Caledon finds out and had plotted against Jack, he falsely accussed him of theft and had him locked away. Not long after, the ship encounters an iceberg which threatens to wreck it apart. Panic overflows the ship as the crew/staff takes safety precautions, giving people life vests. Soon, the lower parts of the ship begin to drown. Jack is in danger and so Rose is in panic to rescue him from the room in which he is in chains in. She manages to get an axe and breaks the chains. The water was almost head-level. They both swim upwards and get to the top of the ship. Boats were getting filled up, women and children going first. Caledon ushers Rose to go in, promising her that Jack was going to be safe. She doesn't believe him and returns back for Jack. Caledon, furious, chases after Jack and Rose with a gun in his hand. Fortunately all his shots miss and they manage to escape to the top of the ship. Caledon soon fakes having a child in order to board a boat. At this point, the Titanic's end was titing upwards at an extreme angles, people were falling off whilst others were lucky enough to clang onto stuff. Jack and Rose hold on to the top of the ship and get ready to dive into the deep, freezing water. Fortunately, Rose;s life vest allowed her to swim a bit more easily, can not say the same for Jck though. Rose clings onto a wooden boards whilst Jack is barely holds on to it. They pass out and by the time help comes, it was way too late... Jack had frozen to death. Unknowing of that fact, Rose tries to shake him awake until she comes into the shocking realization. Jack drops t the deep ocean, his corpse becoming a part of the ocean. She is then rescued by the crew and taken back. All the survivors from the Titanic are saved by the RMS Carpathia.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

22 March 2019,nirome,10," Timeless and epic masterpiece
","On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it.

","There are two love stories in this film: the first Romeo and Juliet and the second James Cameron and the ship.

The holes for each rivet in the hull of the 1/20th model were drilled by hand and actors who actually resembled the 1st Class passengers aboard ate and drank using teacups and cutlery stamped with the White Star Line emblem. The production is a seamless mix of miniatures, practical effects, CGI and actual footage from the wreck site and also genius in terms of saving money if you investigate further. There's nothing wrong with Leonardo DiCaprio's performance but Kate Winslet shines and, combined with the backstory of the search for the necklace, Titanic as a whole is an entertaining and respectful blend of fact and fiction, very well paced and doesn't feel like a 3 hour film. I'm a Titanic buff, so biased - the final few minutes of the ship tearing in two with hundreds of people still clinging to the stern makes me wince every time - but James Cameron's version of the disaster genuinely ticks every box.

","I wasn't really looking forward to this film, its a 3 hour romance movie and I am not a big fan of romance, but I gave this a chance and I have to say this is genuinely one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie manages to focus on a relationship between 2 different classes while also keeping it interesting with mystery, an intensity of what might happen, dread for the inevitable ending and also make many other characters interesting in there own right. The romance is done in a very realistic way and because of all the reasons I mentioned, the naturalistic acting of the actors and just how fun most of the characters are to watch on screen the movie really works. They also show the present and while I personally think that's the weakest part of the movie it does supply some interesting plot points and make the film more enjoyable overall as you're not constantly stuck in the past, the ending is also given a much more satisfying conclusion due to the present time scenes. Finally the 3rd act of the movie where the ship comes to its end is done in a brutal way showing just how much ruffles death it caused, how desperate the people where and how sad it was. The movie doesn't pull a punch and due to its long run time you almost feel like you know what it'd be like and almost like you yourself where there. Honestly I massively recommend giving this movie a change 10/10.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the opening sequence of Titanic, a group of treasure hunters send a robotic probe far beneath the ocean's surface in search of treasures (and one particularly precious jewel) still tucked aboard the titular sunken ship. The camera attached to the probe reveals a vessel that's certainly rotted but still carries hints of its prior glory. The explorers coo and sigh as they see what's been waiting a century for them, as if they're looking at their dreams made manifest. This is the day they've fantasized about, and the treasures of people who once lived and loved aboard the RMS Titanic are their bounty. When the film was released, it was a gamble the size of ... well, the metaphors present themselves a bit too easily. It was a wild risk, both for filmmaker James Cameron (who was known for Aliens and his Terminator movies) and for the studios that funded it, Paramount and 20th Century Fox. Cameron's terrible temper and a runaway production with troubles to spare - one disgruntled crew member laced the chowder at craft services with PCP one night, provoking hallucinations in 50 people, including cast member Bill Paxton - had prompted people to wonder if the legendarily expensive film was doomed for the same fate as its subject. The production budget reportedly ran over $200 million, an enormous sum by any contemporary standards that was much more so in 1997. Titanic remained No. 1 at the North American box office for 15 weeks in a row. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and won 11 of them, including Best Picture. The movie continued playing in theaters for nearly an entire year, and didn't close until October 1, 1998, after earning $600 million in North America and twice that worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until 2010, when Cameron's Avatar wrested away the title. Titanic is two movies stitched together: a swoony teenage fantasy for the ages, and a massive disaster movie that rivals any disaster movie to come out of Hollywood either before or since. The lengthy runtime makes perfect sense by this rubric, and you can see the seam where the movie pivots from one to the other, almost exactly at the halfway mark. That Titanic is two movies in one is part of its genius: If it were just the romance, it might have been written off as a ""movie for girls,"" but then there's this whole other disaster element too. From a marketing perspective, that's gold.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie.

","James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments.

I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw this film long ago but remember that it took my breath away and we are still talking about this movie.
The fictional story of two main actors was absolutely beautiful. Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.

DiCaprio saw the role's potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here. Winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career. Give this one a try and see if you like it.

25 January 2019,imdb-58910,10," My favorite film
","I absolutely like this movie! It is the best romantic drama, fantastic direct, gripping music, very good actors, beautiful story... great combination that predestines good results. The film stars Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson).
The story is about young lover were so different world. Rose is very rich girl. She is engagement with rich man- Caledon Hockley. Rose is unhappy, she must leave to New York to she could get married in NYC. They travel in upper-class with her mother Ruth. Jack and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. Rose want kill herself. Jack- poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship. Lovers met and love story started...
This story always inspiring me and I often thinking about this film, this story. About lifes a thousand people, about ,,Ship of dream""
My opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved. Titanic is about this.
You will certainly give me the truth when I write that Titanic is very moving.

21 May 2011,nickmesafilms,10," Titanic (1997) - I'm the King of the World!!!!!!!!!!!
","Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. ""Titanic"", in my review, ""a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.""",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv
8 February 2022,guskeller,9," Pop culture perfection
","Titanic is pop culture perfection. It's everything wide audiences crave and has elite craft. Even the writing (its weakest aspect) is fair. The love story is generic, but it's efficient and accents the dramatic disaster. In some ways, that romance is just right because the setting is already complex. More nuance could've overly complicated the film. Sometimes, simplicity is not only desired by audiences, but also required by circumstances. Meanwhile, the acting is quality. Leo is fine, Winslet is great, and the supporting cast is strong. All together, this provides the ideal amount of emotional investment to synergize with Titanic's grand spectacle.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","I saw a dismal film ahead, when I first saw the opening credits, but it was still entertaining, and a little tragic.  In the typical James Cameron style, this film is just crawling with stuff you wouldn't believe.  The movie starts out dull, with Gloria Stuart helping to pad out the first ten minutes, but then it really gets rolling!  Afterwards, I had to ask myself: Hey, got a cigarette?  I felt spent, and that's typical of Cameron movies too.  If Cameron made a biblical film, I bet he'd have a twenty minute crucifixion scene.  The sinking was incredible, and they saved the best for last; the rest is just another day on board a Loveboat style rip-off.  Oh well, Cameron's not much without his special effects here, but that's what everyone who goes to see this movie already knows.  James Cameron should stop giving himself Orson Welles injections, and just stick to making action movies.  I just keep thinking of those slick effects in his other films, and how beautiful they all were.  This movie?  I guess James was just trying to display some emotion, but it was corny.  The sinking is what this movie's about. Rating: 7/10 (Bill Paxton must have been depressed about his part in the movie)",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv
21 August 1999,curtis-8,," ""A Night to Remember 3""
","I liked ""Titanic"". Its a good old fashioned adventure/romance/epic with a strong storyline and definable characters. Sure the tacked on romance is as stock as the characters, but that is still better than the alternative served up by most modern movies: ie--no plot and no characterization at all. The thing that bothers me about this version of the Titanic sinking is that writer/director Cameron takes full credit for the screenplay, when so much of it was directly lifted from a 1958 film about the event, ""A Night to Remember"" (also a book, and a previous film). And I'm not talking about the fact the Titanic sunk, or any of the other factual details of the story--obviously those will be the same. I'm talking about virtually identical scenes, events, and dialogue that could not be gathered from public record. Scenes such as the ship's builder standing alone in the tilted ballroom, looking at the painting on the wall as the ship goes down. Or the rich ship corporation a**hole being told that yes, his ship is going to sink, no matter what he says. Or identical scenes of the steerage rabble breaking through the gates. These scenes, and many others, are mounted and shot in so similar a fashion to the previous film, with such similar dialog, that I believe they cross the border into plagerism. Rent the 1958 version of ""A Night to Remember"", watch it, and tell me I'm wrong.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor.

","While I admit that the effects were good and the costumes worked - the film as a whole was awful. Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him.

","I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!).

11 June 2016,Rueiro,3," Titanic: the parody
","This film is so full of absurdities and clichés that it is to all the previous Titanic films what ""Airplane"" is to the ""Airport"" saga and ""Blazing Saddles"" is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of ""But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!"" He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling ""I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will"" And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"" The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

Leonardo DiCaprio was born for the role of Jack Dawson, he makes the audience fall in love with him rapidly, and not just because of his looks. Kate Winslet represents well the role of a young girl in need of freedom. Everything about the movie was outstanding. The setting is a very similar replica too the actual RMS Titanic. It is very realistic since several characters did in fact exist. The special effect are great, seeing in 3D must be quite the experience. The music, My Heart Will Go On, also one of my favorite songs.

","One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancé, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. ★★★★ 4 stars.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding ""DiCraprio"" was just icing on the cake for him.

15 September 1999,Tommy-92,7," Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good
","Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv
5 March 2005,thatsweetbird,1," Best Picture?????????
","Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic (1997): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton: It became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise. A drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the Titanic and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy. Director James Cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as The Terminator and Aliens. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who steers Kate Winslet away from a potential suicide. She is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle. They fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger. Predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship. DiCaprio and Winslet are basically Romeo and Juliet under different names. Billy Zane is embarrassing as her jealous fiancé who scowls and pursues them with a gun. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers. Huge achievement for Cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it.

","I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","There isn't much to say about this film other than incredible. A true epic masterpiece. I admit to seeing it five time in the theater an countless times since then. Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichéd as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature. It was almost better back in the day when it was split up into two tapes and I would never put the 2nd one in because it was too heartbreaking to sit through. This film is truly a masterpiece.

23 May 2000,Covey-3,," Oi, Cameron. No.
","The problem director and writer James Cameron faces with a story about the Titanic is that the majority of his audience will know what happens. So to make his audience care, he switches the action and main plot from the ship, to a socially inappropriate love story between Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. The trouble is that by incorporating the love story theme into the story, he seems to detract from the feel and humanity that previous Titanic films like A Night to Remember have had. Cameron instead opts for two separate halves to the story rather than melding the two separate elements together. The first half concentrating on building an audience rapour with the two main characters, while the second half concentrates on the special effects fuelled sinking of the doomed liner. This would be forgivable if it weren't for several key factors from the first half, the main weakness being the utterly one dimensional lead characters we are presented with. From Caledon Hockleys loveless millionaire to Rose's trapped innocence to Jack Dawson's poor boy with a dream. Aswell played as these characters are, the performance can't make up for the poorly written characters the actors have been given. Again, with the spectacle of the story of the titanic and the millions of dollars at Cameron's disposal, one could forgive the weakness of the characters, but then the  first half of the story is so entirely cliché ridden and full of predictability that it becomes obvious. It is clear that she will leave her safe life and existence and go with the unpredictability of true love. It is almost as though Cameron knows how to tell this story visually, he's just not sure or not capable of making you care about it. Cameron's writing has always come under scrutiny. The comic book quality of films like True Lies and the Terminator films set the scene for his writing style. The childlike quality of some of the dialogue shouldn't but does stand out. ""Something Picasso"" and Freud, is he a passenger?"" are so dire that they belong in a Farrelly Brothers film, not a $200 million blockbuster. Cameron does seem to be writing from the heart, the trouble is that his heart doesn't seem up to the task. ""It's pay-day boys"" and Dicaprio's now legendary ""I'm the king of the world"" seem not to be spoken by the characters in the film, but by Cameron himself. He is the master film-maker who can resurrect the Titanic and will make a fortune from it.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into the Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story. But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted.

","It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling ""all right"" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me.

","I don't get it. What was spectacular about Titanic? Sure, the special effects were nice for the time, but groundbreaking? Not in my book. The characters were... well likable. Not lovable, nor classic, but likable. The plot? Cookie-cutter. Poor boy meets rich girl, poor boy falls instantly in love with rich girl, rich girl does the same, poor boy dies (Seriously, were you not expecting someone to die. You knew the boat was going to sink). Throw in a historical tragedy, and Wam! Insta-plot. And it gets 11 Oscars. What happened?

","Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","There has been nothing similar before and it's hard to imagine something like titanic will ever be created that masterfully & epic again.
I will not respond to any low ratings and leave these viewers alone with their well, opinion. To me TITANIC is the definition of perfection. It came to the absolutely right time. Maybe a few years earlier or later the impact to society would have been less big or even bigger? anyway it influenced a whole generation and even a decade later it has not lost a single spark. It's still the one and only benchmark for any movie. Titanic inspires young and old, brings everyone with a heart to tears and impresses with the highest level of detail in movie making. I'm so thankful I was part of the premiere and the re-screening.
Titanic delivers the perfect 10 on all levels. The attention to detail, eg the dishes and furniture have been all recreated 1:1 to the original. The cast, Katy Bates & esp Kate Winslet (who, in my opinion was shockingly robbed to win her 1st academy award. Alone for heart breaking deleted scene where she had a mental breakdown was one of the best performances by any actress !) and then of course the score: haunting & epic. Recognizable under millions of other melodies including the modern classic my heart will go on.
And when this beautiful ship hits the iceberg and the desaster evolves into the inevitable I know I will weep at exactly the same scenes ... and I'll never let go.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time.

24 July 2007,ianlouisiana,9," A brilliantly assembled mishmash of movie clihes-wonderful!
","""Titanic"",like ""Gone with the wind"" is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so ""Titanic"" repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a ""great"" movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even ""opportunist"" might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and ""Titanic"" has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the ""buts"" and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clichés one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched ""Titanic"" six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry. Furthermore I would say that anybody not similarly affected would not feature highly on my Christmas Card list.

6 June 2012,KineticSeoul,7," Has all the right elements to be a great romance movie for the mainstream audience
","I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","There were three good sides to this film: the beautifully filmed sinking scene, the sets and costumes, and Billy Zane's performance. Add to that the tragic story of the real Titanic, naturally. Besides this, that theme song is irritating, Kate Winslet's performance sucks and her character is simply annoying, and pretty, clean-cut Di Caprio isn't believable as his character, looks wise that is, his performance is not bad. His (double) performance in the Man in the Iron Mask is better, much, much better. All in all, I don't think the movie deserved all that hype, and I definitely wouldn't vote for 'The Titanic' as the best movie of all times.

The way the movie begins, showing some people making the search of Titanic and even some shots of the ship forgot in the sea is very interesting and in the last scene, when the old Rose dies, it's a beautiful and symbolic scene to see her meeting again Jack and all the people that were killed in Titanic's disaster again.",/review/rw0437163/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think what I most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone.

If you are interested in history it handles the Titanic story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered, i.e. The band playing during the sinking. If you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging. If you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects. And if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film let's you be with relative ease. None of these threads really dominate the film and Cameron does a great job balancing all of them.
