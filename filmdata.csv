","A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take apart any movie that is out there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved to have watched this on an IMAX screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan has put on screen here. It's not only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the story/ride you take with it. It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I think just about everything has been said about this film now. But, I can still tell you what this masterpiece is to me. To me, this movie is possibly the most relevant movie ever, because it questions our own humanity relative to the Universe. Whether that's our ability to love, think, or persevere and walk into the unknown. We are explorers, and curious at heart. This untameable curiosity is not our end, but our beginning. It is what advanced this civilization and it will continue to do so. So never, never let anybody tell you that we shouldn't look towards the stars and wonder, because that's what makes us human.

His daughter Murphey thinks there is a ghost in her room; Cooper doesn't believe in ghosts but accepts that something is there when the dust on the floor is a set of coordinates in binary form. He goes to that location and finds himself at a NASA base where he learns of a secret programme to find another habitable world involving a wormhole discovered near Saturn. He is asked to take part in a mission to find the best planet out of three orbiting a black hole; each of which has a scientist who went on a one way mission sending data back. The plan is to find a world to transfer humanity to but if that is impossible there is a back-up plan for the crew to raise the 5000 embryos stored aboard their ship.

","I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are.

25 November 2014,zardoz-13,10," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

1 November 2014,tardieu-felix,10," Interstellar : An open-hearted & mastered Human Odyssey
","The film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions: men overexploited land resources, which is why the only goal they have left is to survive. This life is not enough for Cooper, brilliantly played by McConaughey who gave body and soul to this character. But all of this wouldn't hold without the total control of Christopher Nolan, based on the languishing soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, the luminous and impenetrable photography of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and the sincerity of Nolan's directing. He manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time, always in harmony with Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years. Thus we are transported into the same cockpit that Cooper, we feel the same remorse that he can already feel, we feel the same gravity, and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will. All of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice, which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film: to directly jump from when Cooper leaves in his truck, leaving his family behind him, to Endurance taking off. This simple editing decision allows Nolan to give an original movement to his film, and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

He gets help from Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway again and a couple more familiar faces. One year after Cuarón with Gravity, he discovers the endless widths of space as well. The difference, however is that a large part of his movie, including the first 40 minutes or so completely, plays down on Planet Earth. However, it is also about survival in space, including two people instead of one though. Or you could probably say the whole human race and not one individual fate.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

1 December 2014,tavm,9," Interstellar is quite an intriguing space movie requiring some attention to the narrative
","Just watched this on IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend who had seen this before. It has Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway going to space and seeking possible livable planets for places to move the earth people when that planet becomes uninhabitable. Christopher Nolan directs quite a long but mostly intriguing tale of how long this journey lasts and the effect on McConaughey's offspring when they grow up without having him around during those times. I have to admit that part of me was ready to sleep during some scenes but something exciting does always come up and it gets a little better as the narrative keeps on going. So on that note, Interstellar is very much worth seeing if you're patient enough to watch quite a long movie requiring you to think.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

3 April 2015,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,9," Leaves you wondering
","A lot has been said and heard about this movie but none of it comes even close to the experience of watching it. It has all the elements of a Nolan movie and just like in all of his other movies he decides to go a bit further. This time, he went a little too far. The story behind the movie has it's flaws. There really is no explanation of what happened/is happening. Instead you are given fragments in the first half of the movie hoping one will put all the pieces together. All in all, the first part seems a bit rushed and leaves you wondering if more could have been told. But, since the real story is not why the travel is necessary but the travel itself once the crew is off, the story really kicks in. The main part of the movie gives a great ride, pumps your blood with adrenaline from time to time and gets you emotional pretty often. The problem I personally had was that the story taking place simultaneously on Earth was less shown than I expected. A different approach was expected but that did not stop Chastain from giving the best role in the movie. The last part of the movie is dynamic and filled with problems real people would have if found in a situation like that. But the explanation given at the very end was a bit to much for me. I heard that this was called ""the most scientifically accurate movie"" and that physicist around the world fought over the fact was that true or not. Nevertheless, way too much theoretical physics in the end. Since I love SF movies I am willing to look past the over- the-top science part, but what really got to me was that it was predictable. From the very moment I saw a black hole in the movie I put two and two together and that kinda ruined it for me a little. Regarding the acting, as I said before, Chastain gave the most powerful performance in the movie. She doesn't have much screen time, but she sure knows how to use it. The two that actually lead the movie - McConaughey and Hathaway were brilliant. McConaughey did a little better job handling the emotions of a father with the responsibilities of a team leader and the savior of mankind. His performance was outstanding. Hathaway was good, decent, without a single word that can be said against her, but for a movie like this, that is almost completely on the shoulders of the actors, she should have done more. The others did a good job, particularly Casey Affleck who's character was a grand comparison to Chastain's. The music given it was done by the mastermind Hans Zimmer was spectacular. Just the right notes, just the right timing, just the right music. His understanding of what movies should sound like is amazing. All in all, Interstellar is a magnificent movie. It is a type of movie Nolan does best. It has all the elements of being a classic like Kubrick's 2001: a space odyssey, it comes really close to being the new space odyssey, and it will not perish with time. Still, this might be a bit too much for the average moviegoer, a lot has to be digested here, it is not a simple or easy movie to watch. But, if your braincells don't shut off and you don't expect another Die Hard movie, you will appreciate this masterpiece.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

A grand ensemble of talent assembled but it is truly a shining moment of cool-as-a-cucumber and deeply felt performance by McConaughey as the astronaut/pilot of the journey into the realms of desperation, anchoring the film with a transfixing turn (largely due to his interplay with young talented actress Foy as his daughter - later played with clear-eyed intensity by Chastain), no easy task with all the eye candy visuals that are indeed awe inspiring and a kissing cousin to GRAVITY for sheer amazement (one must see it on a big screen and IMAX would be a start as it was filmed in the medium). Hathaway has a few moments as well particularly with her brainy scientist dad Caine (a Nolan regular).

","8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating ""long-distance"" relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet.

The reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie. There are some movies that words just cannot do justice to. The last one I felt that way about was The Passion Of The Christ. This is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say it's just not enough. I loved Gravity and this was 1,000 times better. Overall, really nothing I can say about this movie other than watch it. Christopher Nolan is a genius.

7 November 2014,shawneofthedead,7," A good - not great - movie that falls apart the more you think about it.
","Not many directors have the clout of Christopher Nolan. Most of them receive notes from their fretting studios: suggestions (or demands) to change plot points or highlight certain characters/actors, which must be adhered to for contractual or financial reasons. With huge, intelligent blockbuster successes like the Dark Knight franchise and Inception, Nolan has deservedly won carte blanche from Warner Bros. for Interstellar - he gets garguantan sums of money and complete autonomy to realise his artistic vision. In effect, he's making an indie movie on a blockbuster scale. Ironically, this lack of oversight might be just what keeps Interstellar - a very good, occasionally brilliant foray into the furthest reaches of our galaxy and beyond - from greatness.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-fi. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Having said this, I believe that many viewers were divisive over the plot's complexities.

Alright so Matthew McConaughey is an ex spaceship pilot, stumbles upon NASA cuz, you guys, the government is evil now, is recruited for a mission to save the planet by finding another planet to colonize. Plan A is to evacuate Earth and move to that planet. That plan (SPOILERS!) is a sham. The real plan is Plan B, which is to repopulate the new planet with embryos. So is Anne Hathaway going to give birth to a hundred babies? How exactly is that going to work? They save Matt Damon. He turns out to be evil and loyal to Plan B. Sets about his own doom by ignoring all warning signs that his airlock is not secure (seriously?!). Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey set sail for another planet. But Matthew McConaughey goes rogue and gets sucked into a black hole. The power of love transports him to his daughter's bedroom (?) - but IN THE PAST YOU GUYS, and he sends messages with Morse Code. Apparently transferring all of the data he's learned about...something or another...through Morse Code (that's one heck of a compression scheme), which allows his daughter to save humanity. He then gets saved from the black hole (?). Reunites with daughter on Saturn (?). And sets up the premise for the sequel. The plot isn't so much twisting and turning as it is just convulsing and flatlining. I didn't really care about any of the characters - actually Matt Damon was the most interesting.

","I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

20 April 2015,westsideschl,3," A Dumbing Down Experience
","A lot of mistaken pop science and poor attention to details makes this film a dumbing experience. Films based in history, biography and science need both the writers and viewers to do the hard work of reading the appropriate research so that we are bettered by the film experience. Director's/producers need to pay attention to detail for excellence. As follows: 1. Blight is usually strain or variety specific and is easily constrained by climate variability and solved easily with cross or genetic breeding. Source and type of blights was never explained probably because it just can't happen the way depicted. 2. Dust storms would be limited to a few limited environs and would soon hit bedrock. Besides, crop rotation and contouring should have solved that problem. 3. Drone was suppose to have been aloft for years using solar panels, but no solar panels visible. Propulsion was? 4. The pulp fiction fable of no Apollo/non-moon landing event is not taken seriously by anyone who is a middle school graduate. 5. McConaughey did his famous finger rubbing thinking prior to kicking a tire but what makes no sense is how kicking a tire makes a vehicle functional. 6. Movie relied on an excessive amount of loud tonal sound effects to create drama when writing and acting just not up to the task. 7. Communicating in barcode or Morse is not how any intelligent future beings would rely on. And, later the gravity–quantum equations coming from the future in Morse which doesn't have Calc encodings. Certainly not through watch hand movement. 8. Female role model in Hathaway was cast for smile/looks not for contributing anything believably intelligent. 9. Dad, Dr. Brand, also poorly cast only for accent and stereotyped science look. 10. Dropping bombs on starving people was presented as a solution – that sounded really ridiculous. 11. Looking for new Earth in another Galaxy when your own offers millions of possibilities is like looking for new home on the other side of the planet when one just like it is next door. 12. The energy required to open or even enter a wormhole would be equivalent to the total of our Sun's output for a thousand years. Also, if you can place it next to Saturn then why not closer like next to Mars to make transporting humanity easier. 13. The wormhole as well as the blackhole would shed matter to subatomic particle size. Communicating through a wormhole. Whoever wrote that has no idea of the scale of problems. 14. Speaking of Mars it can be terraformed with a few H-bombs to release CO2 to warm the planet thus melting subsurface ice to give H20 thus oxygen. 15. Turning on and off hibernation is not like opening the fridge; too many opportunities to damage cells. 16. Underground centrifuge space station was constructed of massive concrete which has only compressive strength not tensile strength. 17. Centrifuge center had a Saturn type rocket (100m high) which when blasts off should destroy that whole complex. In reality a complex that large and built underground would bankrupt half the world. 18. Those quantum gravity equations would not fit on that small blackboard. And, why are they using a blackboard in a tech world capable of traveling easily through space? Surely they must have at least an iPad! 19. So, not explained was how love brought Cooper through multiple dimensions (possibly Universes) to the exact correct time & space that Murph happened to occupy. Probably because the writer couldn't. 20. TARS sounded military dumb and those legs are not designed for surviving uneven surfaces without damage, let alone running. 21. The film's ending of throwing papers, the Eureka and the anonymous kiss was typical Hollywoodish. 22. Ranger view of Earth did not show a devastated planet but normal cloud cover; normal water and land color. 23. Five dimensional space-time is decades old-hat. Seven, nine and for the past dozen years; eleven dimensions is now the most likely mathematical construct. Remember that's all this is - a construct. 24. The effort to push books off a shelf would either be equally the same in all dimensions or not possible so that extra effort shown was just dramatic invention. 25. The interweaving of 1990s cars and other old tech, such as lap tops, all simultaneous with space vehicles & stations not yet achievable for several more decades, didn't make sense - incongruous. 26. The alternate Earth being made habitable by altering some made-up chemistry between chlorine and ammonia and their relation to N2 didn't make planetary chemistry sense, especially since such a planet would be hundred thousand times more rare than the more abundant habitable planets; also most likely more than a -100 degrees below zero.

","Interstellar is a masterpiece of both visuals, science fiction, reality, and story. What makes this movie so good to people, is the fact of how everything is executed. 
The camera work and visuals in Interstellar use both CGI and real word environments. The water planet was not a stage, but actually a glacier in Iceland. The combination of visuals with the props, costumes, etc. are what make this film look so breathtaking. 
The Sci Fi aspect of Interstellar comes mostly into affect when Joesph Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) enters a black hole in the final minutes of the movie. This sends him to what can only be described as a different dimension, that has the ability to bridge both space and time. The nickname for this dimension (but only because it appears in a way Coop can understand and use it) is the space bookcase. The bookcase is the one in his daughter Murph's bedroom. It's here that he can see that the coordinates and things that were laid out for him on Murph's floor to get him into space in the first place was laid out for him, by him. This would constitute as a time loop, but while Interstellar does involve theoretical time physics in its plot, it does not dabble with time travel as a whole concept. This part of the movie is what falls into the Sci Fi genre, in that we don't know if something like this could actually happen. 
The Reality aspect of Interstellar actually involves most of the film as a whole. Most of the science and equations used in it are in fact, real world science. 
Lastly, the story. The story is well written, the dialogue is great, and it defines each character so that each person has their own traits and quirks. 
All in all, everything in this movie gets wrapped up into the beautiful work that is Interstellar. I would strongly suggest this movie, in that it makes you think just a little bit more.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Amidst the stars in the galaxy known as Hollywood a deep mystery remains: who is Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker? After seeing Interstellar in IMAX, his ninth and least satisfying film, the question perpetuates. Nolan is one of the most powerful and bankable directors in the world. Together, his last four films earned nearly four billion dollars. Money builds opportunities and egos in Hollywood and consequently each entry in Nolan's filmography has grown in size and scope. Yet outside of his admiration for 35 mm film and practical effects, grasping Nolan's auteurist imprint is difficult. He says he wants to make the biggest film possible but so does Michael Bay. Nolan's films walk a difficult line, balancing large ideas and explosions, proving blockbusters don't have to be mindless.

","I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.

","I give it a 5 only because it is an overly sentimental at times, ludicrous in its storyline, bloated sci-fi attempt at landing the Nolans some Oscars. A manipulative almost-dross. Chris Nolan is simply too ambitious for his own good. The comparisons with Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey are demeaning to Kubrick, they are not in the same league as film directors. Kubrick pandered to the intellect and treated viewers with respect, Nolan panders to the American Film Academy and the box office, and treats viewers with disrespect. Kubrick was a film artist, Nolan is a film craftsman and a businessman, nothing more. Interstellar contains too much talking, too much exposition. One astronaut explains to another the basics of how black holes work, like to a little child and just moments before they are to enter one? Pleeease. And what's with this father-daughter love and bond, crazy and all? The crying and weeping, she breaks into a crying fit more than 20 years later (kid you not) at the thought that daddy might have deceived her?? The underlining thesis of the film is that ""love is the only thing (a ""thing""??) which overcomes time and space"". Corny and retarded, and so very Hollywood. Emotional and family-oriented string-pulling is at the core of Hollywood filmmaking business, that's what makes them mega bucks, so they go on manipulating. Chris Nolan is either emotionally infantile or a manipulative hack, a film artist he is not. Basically the only element in the film that I liked very much was the music score, I found it very pleasing and strangely not overbearing, though there is a lot of it in almost every scene. Even the much-praised special effects and shots of the cosmos do not impress, for me there is not a single scene that gives a feeling of enormous vastness of space and how the Earth is but a tiny, little speck like a grain of sand on an ocean beach.

","Interstellar (2014): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Michael Caine: The future looks grim with sand storms destroying everything and corn pretty much the only thing growing. As with Inception, Christopher Nolan toys with the theme of time. This time a farmer and pilot, played by Matthew McConaughey leaves his young son and daughter with their grandfather and then leads an expedition to space through a worm hole. This is in hopes of finding planets to colonize on. Unfortunately complication arise when McConaughey discovers that his son and daughter are now grown adults in the span of a few hours that he was on the first planet, surfaced mainly of water. Watching someone be subdued with grieving regret while his children rapidly grow old is very depressing. It lends the idea of valuing time spent with loved ones. McConaughey is caught in such a dilemma and hopes that his daughter is bright enough to figure it all out. Anne Hathaway plays the daughter of the scientist heading the research, and who joins McConaughey on the mission. Jessica Chastain plays the now grown daughter, stubborn, determined, and clever to boot. Matt Damon plays an astronaut revived from hyper sleep on an ice planet with a secret mission of his own. Michael Caine plays the scientist heading the research that might outlive him. This is hardly an uplifting experience but it contains Nolan's signature curiosity of time.

The plot sees a series of unexplained events bringing a farmer and former pilot into a group looking to save humanity from the earth, which is currently killing itself and threatening to take mankind with it. Looking to the stars, in particular a black hole which seems to have been placed nearby to allow for travel to much more distant worlds, he learns of previous missions to scout out other planets on the other side, and that he is needed to lead a mission to follow up the promising leads, leaving his family behind potentially forever.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

17 November 2014,ironhorse_iv,8," Interstellar was indeed pretty stellar.
","Interstellar will divide the audience. Some of them will love and enjoy this movie, while others will see it as a boring film and feel the long 3 movie pace. Interstellar is no way, a popcorn fun film. It's a smart man film. It's remind me, so much of 1968's 2001: A Space Odessey, both in visuals and how people reaction to it. Both films, receive mixed reactions from critics and audiences alike. I think like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this movie, Interstellar will garnered a cult following and slowly became a bigger box office hit, but right now, it's up in the air. While, the movie seem to taking a lot of homage to that film, Interstellar seem grounded by the director own identification. It's a film that couldn't blast away, even if a lot of determination went into making this film. The reason is, because people have become so aware of what Director & Writer Christopher Nolan will do. Without spoiling it, too much, the movie has a lot of overused Nolanism tropes & clichés. This means a lot of exposition dialogue with characters explain through dialogue their innermost feelings, instead of, acting those emotions out. Add the elaborate, flashback-heavy narrative structure, and lots of science mucho jumbo, and you get a film that will confused people. Some people think, it is a fallacy, but in my opinion, it's not inherently bad. They're alright in the right doses. People need to be challenge in films. People need to think. If you're so caught up on Nolanisms, you'll never let yourself enjoy the film, as a whole. I think some people just didn't get it. I don't blame them, I love the film, but parts of the film are indeed slow pace, and hard to understand. Even with a love for Quantum physics, space travel and psychology before this film, I had a hard time following what's going on. Like 2001 Space Odyssey, this movie lacks the broad appeal to an audience whom unaware for a need of such deep intelligent research. Maybe, it was a bit overreaching in its direction; as the film feels less a film, a more of a science lecture. You really have to tune in; to get, most of it. The trailers were no help, coming in. The film is about a team of astronauts whom travel through a wormhole in an attempt to find a potentially habitable planet that will sustain humanity, because Earth cannot longer manage life. I found a lot of things jarring in the film, like example, how they use a Saturn like rocket to escape out of Earth's astrosphere, but later on the film, they're able to leave, most planet's upper astrosphere with ease with their little spacecraft. A major error that I have spotted is the matter of the planets where gravitational forces cause such extreme time dilation that an hour on that planet equals seven years for us on Earth. Technically, yes, it's a possible, but the gravitational forces necessary to bring this about, would be so extreme that no planet, let alone people, would survive such gravity pull. Why couldn't they go to Saturn's moons? After all, scientists have pointed out that Saturn's moon Titan possesses an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life. Save you the time, and effect. I know, everyone on Earth has infinite resources, despite large blight dust-clouds, but come on! The movie felt like two movies, mixed together. I think the first half of the film movie is very Sci-fiction, with the second half of the film after the wormhole, a bit Sci-fantasy, because how much, it lacks true science. Even if we can make a wormhole, the equations show that they're unstable and they would collapse upon you if you tried to go through. So, that's where the science fiction comes in. Kip Thorne put an amazing amount of research into the film, but the film does have some moments that you might have to suspend your disbelief in. I'm glad, the second half is that way, because it got really boring in the first half of the film. Way too much talking into the first part of the film. Most of the action and tense moments, play out in the second part. One of the biggest fears in the film is Einstein's special theory of relativity. I think the problem of relativity, played very well in the film as characters are afraid of wasting time. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, the former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer is a great role for him. I love the tense relationship with him, and his daughter, Murph played by Mackenzie Foy (Age 11) & Jessica Chastain (Age 37). You really see the pain that Cooper goes through, when he sees his children, growing up fast in front of him. While the ending is very clunky, it was very emotionally and physically draining to watch. Indeed, Matthew could act. He was the anchor that kept the story, grounded. Still, it was bit a stretch, at times, hard to believe, that his character spend most of his later life, farming, but still able to be an accurate ace pilot who can play a spacecraft through black holes, and dock on spinning out of control space station. Jessica Chastain is great in the secondary role. Anne Hathaway, while overacting in her role as Brand, Coop's co-explorer; was mostly alright, despite her character, doing a lot of stupid selfish things. The rest of the supporting cast were pretty good with their parts. I do love the smart ass robots. I thought the visuals were amazing. Must watch on IMAX. I thought the music by Han Zimmer was absolutely beautiful and really made the dramatic scenes including the end scene with the twist all the more engaging. Still, it was overbearing, and the sound mixer were pretty bad as I couldn't hear the dialogue, when the music is playing. Overall: Despite its faults, it's a good movie.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

3 November 2014,trublu215,6," A visually epic film
","Interstellar marks Christopher Nolan's return to the silver screen since ending his Dark Knight trilogy. While Interstellar seems like classic Nolan, it also feels as if he wanted to focus on making the most realistic space film even if the story fell casualty. And it most certainly seems this way. Interstellar has the best effects that I've ever seen in a film. Each shot detailing the vacancy of space, and the planets that orbit gently is so well crafted that it almost makes you forget about the story flaws in the film. While that does remain as a huge advantage that this film has, it also doesn't delude the fact that there are some pretty glaring issues regarding Nolan's story and its characters. The story behind the film starts off as the unlikely hero is tasked with saving the planet...then it starts talking about space and the relation of time and space. While spoon feeding the audience isn't exactly Nolan's forte, it does begin to start sounding like a physics class in some scenes as characters spout off information as if it is supposed to be common knowledge. But, as Nolan intended, this is most definitely not your typical popcorn blockbuster. Interstellar demands multiple viewings and echoes early Stanley Kubrick in style and in pacing but one thing that has kept me from giving this film a higher rating is most definitely the characters. Christopher Nolan can certainly deliver us a GREAT film, his filmography speaks for itself, but Interstellar is one of his few films that features very little in the way of good characters. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway certainly delivered the goods here in regards to their performances, but their characters themselves were very flawed and not well rounded in the least. Their characters are there, strictly to progress the story when it begins to slow down and with a running time of nearly three hours, it certainly does drag in certain scenes. However, despite it feeling long and bloated, the imagery here is more than enough to captivate you. The technical aspects of this film are EXTRAORDINARY. Everything from the beautiful, flawless cinematography to the robust sound design, everything here is utterly flawless on a technical level. It makes for a truly engrossing theater experience, if nothing else. Overall, Interstellar feels like a film that is bound to divide audiences and while I didn't love the film outright, there's a lot to this film to admire and appreciate.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Moreover, it really is the first movie that really explained the four dimensions of space and time to me in utterly breathtaking fashion. Nolan really managed to make astronomy interesting again and in a world where education is becoming undervalued, inspires us to grow and learn. The movie is filled to the brim with dialogues and lessons that everyone can learn from and understand.

(1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Avatar (2009), Minority Report (2002), Gravity (2013), The Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and all three of the Iron Man movies (2008-2013). Out of all the movies that I just listed it reminds me of Grvity when it comes to the emotions of the characters but this movie telling more of a story, and as well as 2001 when it comes to the visuals.The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a farmer whose daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy)notice that there is drought and famine that leads to dust storms and then they are led to NASA where they will meet a man named Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) who convinces Cooper to go on the mission to save earth and he then agrees to it but hates the feeling of leaving his children behind without seeing them grow up for many years but luckily they have their grandfather (played by John Lithgow) who watches them for the rest of his life. Christopher Nolan's direction and his script (co-written by his brother Jonathan Nolan) are just perfect for the movie to have, and not only that but even Hans Zimmer's suspenseful score is amazing. At this past Oscars ceremony this movie got 5 well deserved Oscar nominations but the only Oscar that it went off with was for visual effects when I think it deserved a whole lot more in my personal opinion. Even the cast delivers great and top notch performances not only from McConaughey, Caine, and Lithgow, but also from Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo as the principal that his kids went to school to, William Devane (who appears on the Rosland Capital commercials) and one of the people who work at NASA, Matt Damon, Topher Grace, and David Gyasi as one of the crew members on the mission.

","Christopher Nolan once again gives more than enough evidence that he is the most overrated director in modern Hollywood. How is it possible to have such a premise (interstellar voyage to save human race) and make such a boring movie? It beats me, but what puzzles me even more is how it is possible to make a movie with almost no character at all. What is this movie about? It's not about an interstellar voyage, that's for sure. It ain't about discoveries, either. (imagine a group of explorers who are some of the first people to land on another planet and they are excited as my 90+ year-old grandmother is when she cooks dinner) It ain't about aliens either. It ain't about saving humanity either, there is hardly any people shown except for one village somewhere in USA. Can you really tell a story that big by wrapping it around just a few people? In theory you can and it could actually work if it made any sense. But to end the movie they it was done here, by placing a portal inside a black hole which is designed to connect only two specific people, two specific people who have accidentally found NASA's basement top-secret James Bond project - it is beyond me. Once Cooper started texting his daughter in Morse code through this portal I felt embarrassed. I felt embarrassed for Nolan brothers. That's it? That was the grand idea which connects the loose ends and saves humanity? I wish Matt Damon had killed them all, it would have been more interesting and much more plausible than this mess.

","This movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it. First off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days, with what I assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was. When a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a Ken Burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way. We have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and I say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be, unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of Morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe. The second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon, space and beyond. Anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked. The last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when Mathew Mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bed,only to chase him out of the room. Then there are the million questions that don't add up, there is no army any more, LOL like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had. Mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie, where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn, and where did NASA come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no US government to build all this crap? Its a known fact that the scientists at NASA built not a darn thing nor ever have, its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them. NASA does not so much as put one bolt in one hole. Micheal Cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning.

","Unlike the majority of the viewers of this film commenting on IMDb I found it flat,unrealistic in the extreme and essentially another Hollywood dud. Many times the people who make these Sci-Fi films will literally flood the IMDb review section with positive reviews, causing the IMDb rating to go up and (they probably hope) causing more people to go see the movie. What disappointed me the most about this movie were the obvious scientific inaccuracies and distortions that made watching it more of a leap of faith rather than an exciting trip into mankind's future. As most people know (adults of course) is that there is no such thing as a ""stable"" wormhole. That premise was used ad infinitum by Star Trek: Deep Space 9, and just as lamely since there is ""no such thing"" as stability when discussing wormholes. Additionally, the ending made essentially no sense whatsoever. What else can I say except skip it unless you love gigantic bulging eyes crying all the time (Anne Hathaway) or checking out Matthew M's pecks. There was very little entertainment in the movie that's for sure. StocktonRob",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2014,therocksbarneyreviews,8," One of Nolan's best, but watch out Chris.
","""Interstellar"" is truly an epic, not in the sense of what we initially think of as an epic, for example ""Ben Hur"" or perhaps even ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (a film which it is worth pointing out I haven't seen), but more in the sense of how when I think back to ""Interstellar"", I think of those visually captivating shots of black, of the unknown and of those desolate landscapes made of water and ice, and how I found myself in awe of them. It is these that come to define ""Interstellar"". Set in the near future, Earth cannot sustain humanity anymore, and it's worth praising Nolan's subtle view of it, be it seeing the New York Yankees playing on an amateur field or discovering that the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union, which Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) denies. This scene, whilst allowing for a sense of character development in regards to Cooper, in retrospect seems to be Nolan emphasising how he sticks to the traditional elements of film and he does so more than ever in this film, from building several rooms of a spaceship from scratch to using five industrial fans to create a dust storm, thus attributing even more of the credit for the film to him. Yet as I expected, it proves very difficult for members of this all- star cast to break through both the visually stunning shots and the label of Christopher Nolan, and be noticed. Only McConaughey succeeds in doing so, although Mackenzie Foy (playing a young Murphy) and Bill Irwin (voicing the robot, TARS) deserve mentions, as does to an extent Michael Caine (playing Professor Brand) and his recital of Dylan Thomas' ""Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"", although I still don't entirely understand its inclusion, leaving big names such as Casey Affleck (playing Tom) and even Jessica Chastain (playing Murphy) ""down in the dirt"". Interstellar is a quintessentially Nolan film, meant to be seen on IMAX, imposing those classic Nolan themes of love and family whilst asking questions that I have not seen asked before, in this case winding up the scientists, although it is interesting to note that Nolan answers them by playing with several theories, instead of just getting the science completely wrong, as is so common. Yet the film is so Nolan that it takes that extra unnecessary step that Nolan always has present in his work, be it taking the audience to Limbo in Inception or by adding the twist of Miranda Tate (played by Marion Cotillard) turning out to be Talia al Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises. Before I conclude, I think it is important to make this point in regards to Nolan and his (future) works. He has begun, whether he means it or not, to dwarf his own cast and to an extent his own themes and his commitment to traditional film elements. The amount of hype that goes into his films is widespread and if he isn't careful, his future works could take a turn for the worse. As I have already said, Nolan always takes that extra unnecessary step, one that I don't think I would be so sympathetic with if it was another director, yet the brilliance of what comes before it makes up for it, often leaving me in that No Man's Land of whether the film was worth 9 or 10 stars.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film is dull and boring and well just forgettable. I imagine by the time I finish this review I will have forgotten most of the film. I will never see it twice. Even people that enjoyed it I would wager they don't rush for a second viewing. Probably most likely only sit through it a second time after 20 years forgetting they'd even seen it. Most talked about the visuals and the sounds. like all Nolan's movies it's big bass and looks good on the eye but unlike Inception this is overly indulgent complicated for the sake of it. The main story behind all the space talk is basically would you spend a life time with your family or give that up and save mankind's race? Answer screw mankind. In the film it's save mankind. As always Hollywood think's humans have a moral compass and we'd all give up our kids for the good of the race. We as humans would not. I would not and proud to say it. My kids come first before all of mankind. Anyone that thinks differently either doesn't have kids or is lying to themselves. And when a movie shows this , I straight away think this main character just left his family behind..what an ass. The film would have been a lot better if it just became what was the only interesting part of it. Rescuing astronauts on new planets. Those parts was the only time I thought cool new planet with stranded person on it this should be interesting. And we got 2 planets and 1 person (Matt Damon) What a pity. Damon was the only person that actually brought the film alive and then he was gone.Damn. Could go through all the space mumble jumble but really can't be bothered. It's duller than watching grass grow. I Like Nolan sometimes but sometimes he goes too far and loses his way(The Dark Knight Rises springs too mind). This film gets way too much credit from loyal fans of his, its up there with his worst movies he's made and I hope he knows it. It's the only way he'l return to making great ones if he see's his mistakes. So to sum up. Dull boring story/way overly complicated/characters no one cares about and by the end your left thinking damn I just lost all that time out of my life and there's no way to bend time to get it back.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

And, apparently, well over 11000 of those votes gave this movie a 10 out of 10 rating because the overall rating is 9.3 - that would mean that not only is Interstellar the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it is far and away the best movie ever made and movies such as The Godfather, Gone with the Wind, etc. are only average by comparison. There are two other possibilities. The first is these 12000 voters have seen only a few movies and they were so bad that this one seemed perfect by comparison.

9 November 2014,jjanerney,10," Incredible cinema
","Lets start by saying that i was astonished by Nolan's vision, mesmerized by the visual, captivated by the plot and touched by the characters. Having waited 11 months for this film and being a huge fan of Nolan perhaps i am not able to provide an objective opinion about this film, but all i can say is that delivered what i wanted and far more. It was astonishing. So lets start with the cinematography, and as usual with Nolan's films it looks pristine. There was no shot misplaced, the tone presented by the camera movements was perfect. Every movement had a purpose and there was no unnecessary 'fluff,' hand-held cameras are used extensively and this gave the film a very pure feel. That being said there were certain scenes were our jaw will just drop. This is partly because of Nolan's genius use of the camera and also partly because he only uses practical effects which made the entire film feel far more real and tangible. The acting in this film is fantastic, the entire sequence between Coop and his daughter at the start of the film is genuinely heart wrenching and incredibly well done by both actors, and throughout the film the acting never once becomes wooden. A quick mention to Hans Zimmer for the most incredible score that held together the film and added so much to the feeling of uncertainty, not once has Zimmer made a bad score and i feel that this is his best score yet. Onto the point of Nolan's films the core focus and what drives the plot is family. Throughout the film i feel Nolan is saying that through this journey mankind is 'evolving'(too say any more would spoil the film) and throughout the film there is a sense that every misstep makes the characters better and smarter. Throughout the entire film some characters constantly say 'we did this i theory but it is completely different in reality' which i feel shows that as the movie progress so do the characters in terms of knowledge and understanding and by the end of the film some even seem like they are a 'higher being.' However throughout the film none of these high concepts feel like they are out of reach or that the film is impossible to relate to because throughout the film the one thing that holds it together is love and family and unbreakable relationships and this remains a touchstone throughout the film that everyone can relate to and understand the film. Let me say this now, although it appears to resemble 2001 I do not believe that it does. 2001 is a very clinical detached film which in my opinion is the greatest film ever, this film is very different. It may be an incredible space Odyssey but unlike 2001 it has 'blood in its veins' and perhaps Interstellar becomes too sentimental at points and it compromises the plot because of it but i feel like this is the point of the film. Nolan wanted to make an epic journey that could be related to(I would argue that 2001 is the greatest film ever but that it is difficult to grasp because of the clinical nature of it). Nolan definitely did this with Interstellar, it is a film that can be grasped and interpreted and related to, but he also made a tremendously epic film that i not simple and tackles subject matter that many directors before have struggled to even get a grasp on themselves never mind convey it in a film so grand. Is this the greatest film ever, o, but it is definitely up there and the fact that a film so complex is the largest film event of the year shows that the audiences that go in their droves to see this film aren't that stupid either. To conclude I salute Christopher Nolan for this film, it was pure incredible film making the lime of which i haven't seen in years, the fact that all i have thought about since the screening is this film and that even after 3 hours I still felt like there should be more shows in my opinion just how great a film this is. This is the best film i have seen in many years and it is my opinion Nolan's crowning work, there has not been a film this ambitious and with this complex a vision made so well since 2001.

1 February 2021,dr_clarke_2,10," A film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish
","Having dabbled with earth-bound science fiction in The Prestige and Inception, 2014's Interstellar saw director Christopher Nolan turn his hand to space-opera. Set in a not-too-distant future in which mankind's crops are failing, the film sees a group of astronauts headed by Matthew McConaughey's Cooper set out through a wormhole in search of a new planet for humanity to colonise. Naturally, they face difficulties, but not of the aliens and space-battle kind; Interstellar provides it characters with more scientifically plausible threats.
As well as directing Interstellar, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan, and it's a characteristically cerebral affair. This is science fiction that had a theoretical physicist as a scientific advisor and the challenges it presents include the effects of relativity, as Cooper's likelihood of ever seeing his children again grows ever more remote, and the gravitational forces of black holes. The story's scale is broad and deep, and is weighty not just in scientific terms, but also philosophical ones, the script musing extensively on the nature and power of love. At the same time, the first part of the film - set in an entirely recognisable near-future American dust-bowl - grounds the film in reality, and by taking the time to explore Cooper's relationship with his daughter Murphy it also provides it with an emotional heart. The film isn't entirely bereft of action however, thanks to the treachery of Matt Damon's Mann, a scientist who realises that his own survival matters to him more than that of mankind's.
The film unfolds relatively sedately over two and three quarter hours, but rather like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is a film so visually beautiful that it's easy to just sit and drink in the spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and so are the sets. There's an internal consistency to the design of the technology that is speaks of great attention to detail, and the novel blocky design of TARS and CASE is ingenious. The film marks cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's first collaboration with Nolan and he does a superb job, not just of the outer space sequences, but also during the location filming, which makes effective use of the panoramic vistas of the Canadian landscape the scenes were shot in to create an impression of a sickly, ailing world. Innovative use of hand-held cameras also helps to emphasise the claustrophobia of the space ship sets and nauseating dizziness of zero gravity. The astonishing visual are complemented by the soundtrack provided by regular Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, which perfectly captures the dramatic but often melancholy atmosphere of the story.
The casting of Matthew McConaughey as Cooper proves to be a masterstroke, as he gives an astonishingly naturalistic and at times emotionally charged performance, especially during Cooper's scenes with Murphy. He leads an impressive cast for an impressive film, and everyone is perfectly suited to his or her role, including Anne Hathaway as Amelia Brand, Matt Damon as the treacherous Mann, and Jessica Chastain as Murphy. Smaller roles are taken by the likes of John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Wes Bentley and Casey Affleck, and they all get under their characters' skins. This being a Christopher Nolan film, Michael Caine also appears, as aging scientist Professor Brand, and he brings quiet dignity to the character.
For all of the film's scientific credentials, Interstellar isn't a documentary: the film's lengthy denouement inside the tesseract takes the story into the realms of pure fantasy, and results in a fairytale happy ending that somehow manages to compliment the theoretical physics of the middle section. There's no reason why it shouldn't: it's an approach that worked for Stanley Kubrick and whilst inviting comparison (even unintentionally) to 2001: A Space Odyssey is asking for trouble, Interstellar compares well. It is a film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish; Christopher Nolan has yet to make a bad film, but it seems distinctly possibly that this one will come to be regarded as his best.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interstellar is a mixed bag, one that makes my emotions flip-flop more than a campaigning politician. On the positive side, the scifi technology, sound design, and score are all initially arresting, with the balletic space visuals and effects greying the line between reality and movie-magic. It's undeniably gorgeous and (at times) speechlessly engrossingso why I am struggling? Maybe it's because my love for the positives is only outmatched by my disdain for the negatives: the ponderous dialogue, the Shyamalan-like ""what-a-twist!"" moments, the bulky length, the dishonest ending. Nolan shot for the moon, got distracted by the stars, and missed his target. Interstellar follows a small band of renegade explorers (led by a nicely grounded performance by McConaughey) who, through a wormhole in space, travel to the furthest parts of the universe to find a new planet for humanity to inhabit. The plot is a science/space enthusiast's dream that combines the terror of Kubrick's 2001 and the awe Spielberg's Close Encounters, only Interstellar is more contrived or melodramatic than either. It's a fascinating study of time and the lengths we go for those we love, but the ponderous, self-aware and weepy nature of the heavily thematic discourse softens the impact, most apparently in the unbearably doe-eyed Hathaway. Every Nolan film is an event, and each is worth grappling with. They are filled with big ideas and big visuals in big worlds. If he could self-edit better, Interstellar could easily be a 5 star film that goes down in the annals of scifi movies.

","As was apparent from his previous film, ""The Dark Knight Rises"", Christopher Nolan has become the preeminent hack in Hollywood--and that's meant as a compliment. Nolan is a committed romantic: the only difference between him and, say, William Wyler, is that Nolan dresses up his love stories with astonishing visual effects and complex plots with a heavy emphasis on spiritualism. ""Interstellar"" is Nolan's most accomplished work yet, with a far more satisfying mise en scene than his previous non-Batman work, the tedious and frustrating ""Inception"", and he finds a more effective means to discuss what is fast becoming his major theme: time's effect on relationships, from the largest (all humanity) to the smallest (families) and his aw-shucks notion of transcendent love is sweet and satisfying. Though there are no real standouts, Nolan gets good performances from Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain and, in supporting roles, Casey Affleck and Nolan stalwart Michael Caine; they're good but where Nolan is going for tearjerking tenderness, the actors don't quite deliver. Still, Nolan's script (written along with his brother, Jonathan) is beautifully written and thought-provoking and the mammoth but necessary effects (an homage to Kubrick, sharply filmed by Hoyte Van Hoytema) are as outsized as Nolan needs them to be.

","A beautiful, ambitious riddle that tackles the weighty topics of time displacement, space exploration, fatherhood and the end of life on Earth. Not necessarily in that order. Like Christopher Nolan's preceding mind-stompers, Inception and The Prestige, it's a crafty, sprawling creation that feeds and grows based on sheer conceptual might. I found it less accessible and rewarding than those two, however, overreaching in the third act to reel us back in after a few digressions. Most of the climax feels like an ill fit, too, discarding two hours' worth of rigorous scientific detail in exchange for a trippy, convoluted plot device and a fairytale ending. In a lot of ways, it's like a mainstream adaptation of the finale seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey, a clear inspiration, in that it's bright, blurry, colorful and confusing. Only this time, the static leads to a cookie cutter epilogue, not a blank canvas. Such complaints notwithstanding, I greatly enjoyed most of the ride to reach that point, even if it has a tendency to belabor a point. Nolan's vision of a near-death civilization on our home soil is vibrant and real. His emphasis on the pain of separation and the dizzying potential of galactic time-shifts are powerful and moving.

If you like stupid movies that make no sense, I suggest you get a copy of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" another amazing insult to your intelligence. At least ""Voyage"" was fun to watch for the mere stupidity. This one is simply extremely boring. The first 45 minutes is Mathew McConaughey as a single father talking to his daughter? You can go to any park on Saturday afternoon and see the single fathers talking to their kids and it will be far more entertaining. Then Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles into a super-secret NASA installation, not in Florida mind you, but apparently in a corn field in Iowa. He is immediately snapped up to pilot the last remaining space ship on a dying planet. He has to save the earth from a dust storm. The angst is that he has to leave his daughter and it might be a few hundred years before he gets back. Here's the reason I write: NASA is sending its last space ship, its only hope to save our species, with a pilot they just met, two other guys and one woman. Huh? If you're going out to find another habitable planet, and chances are the people sent are never coming back, and you send one woman? The writers do know where babies come from, don't they? Anne Hathaway plays ""Brand"" and is the only woman on board. What if she gets killed? What if she is infertile or not very good at getting pregnant? The entire future of the human race is riding on her. She is 32 years old and looks older. They would have been better off leaving Cooper at home and sending his daughter. Any reasonable effort to save the human race would have been to send three young women, one viral young man and a whole lot of frozen sperm. The reason that there is just Hathaway is because of the movie convention that we must always have more dudes. Always. Even if the situation calls for women, even if it only makes sense that the participants be female, there must be mostly men. And director here fell back on the cliché from SI-Fi movies of the 50s: Why is there a chick in the space ship at all? Because she is the daughter of the Professor who is masterminding the project. If the professor didn't have a daughter, they would be all dudes in the space ship. Brand couldn't be accomplished on her own? She gets to be in the space ship because she's the daughter. The science may have come a long way from the 50s, but the male dominated film industry has not. As I said the whole movie made no sense and is an insult to your intelligence.

","Though I haven't seen all of Nolan's films, I have greatly enjoyed what I have seen so far (Insomnia, the Batman trilogy, and Inception), and with sci-fi being one of my favourite genres, seeing 'Interstellar' eventually was a no-brainer for me. Despite its 169 minutes, it didn't seem long at all (if a film is well made, then the longer, the better) and it's resoundingly clear that Christopher is excellent both in getting fine performances from his actors and, along with his brother Jonathan, in writing scripts. What makes the film special for a sci-fi work is that he doesn't have to show any monster--nothing is truly more scary than humanity itself. This is a work that can combine an excellent explanation of the theory of relativity yet still show that the only things that truly matter are the relationships we develop in our everyday lives. My favourite film of all-time is still one of the most ambitious, '2001: A Space Odyssey', but it's very comforting to me that six generations after the birth of cinema, and the Faberge eggs of genius that have come along the way, from Georges Méliès' 'A Trip to the Moon' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', that outstanding works of science fiction, such as 'Gravity', 'Ex Machina' and this fine film by Nolan, are still being made.

Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way.

","There are some great moments in this film but fatal flaws in the story and script. It does succeed in building suspense and providing a visual ""wow"" factor, but only after it has lost viewer conviction by a lot of silliness and implausibility. I went to see it as I do many sci-fi films hoping to have a similar experience to that provided by 2001 : a Space Odyssey in the 1960s. Alas recent attempts all fall short by comparison, by succumbing to the temptation to include a lot of cheap tricks. Instead of relying on the scenario, story and setting to provide the engagement factor, American directors can't resist introducing the macho hero, the improbable baddie and schmaltzy sentimentality. Oh for a bit of discipline! The first part of the film is frankly painful. Matthew McConaughey drawls and postures and has a vapid open-mouthed expression most of the time. It's pretty much impossible to understand what he is saying. The situation on Earth is difficult to understand and doesn't achieve any credibility. The science seems to be gobbledy-gook, which holds for the entire film. Interest improves when they get out into space and some of the situations create considerable tension, enabling the viewer to sit out the film with a better grace. Towards the end the story disintegrates into incomprehensible nonsense. A lot of the sentimental basis of the film rests on Cooper's relationship with his daughter, so it's a significant flaw that the 3 actresses who play her do not resemble each other facially (obviously a problem, but not handled well). Matt Damon can't do much with his admittedly silly part, and doesn't look too interested. Altogether, what a waste of resources. This film needed a guiding genius, as I am assuming the weaknesses reflect ""too many cooks"".

Even his last film was an event for the year, but that quickly evaporated upon The Dark Knight Rises' bafflingly clumsy last hour. I still cherish The Dark Knight and Inception, but it looks like he's out of juice. Not that Interstellar is bad, it just never soars like those films do. Perhaps it's due to rampant expectations.

","The movie starts very slowly. There's hardly anything interesting in the first hour. During that time, I almost fell asleep in the theatre. Despite the commendable efforts to make it comply with the predictions of modern physics like time dilation, twin paradox, etc. the plot is still full of gaps and utterly nonsensical actions which defy your logic. The ""scientific"" references to quantum mechanics, general relativity and string theory (this one is rather implicit...) in the dialogues are very pretentious and most of the time plain silly. The only parts of the movie that would evoke interest and probably keep you awake are as usual about human drama, power struggle and emotional encounters. In this regard, all the efforts to make it compatible with the laws of modern physics become useless and a waste of time. Indeed, I have yet to see any movie that can pull it off since ""Contact."" In this regard, I'd rather see ""dumb"" sci-fi movies which concentrate on drama like the first and 2nd gen Star-Trek than this sort of half-ass physics-wanna-be stuff which fail to address your imagination.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interstellar is a movie that never gets off the ground. Based on a script that wanders from end to end attempts to comprehend its plot and themes are very difficult for the viewer. Heavily weighted with Academy Award winners including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine and Ellen Burstyn they are never able to surmount this poorly written script. From the beginning it was obvious many elements of Interstellar were lifted from other films. These included 2001 a Space Odyssey and Enemy Mine. Promising not to giveaway details Muppets in Space was more enjoyable. Interstellar starts in a backwater town and ends on a planet 2nd rate planet.

","Review: I honestly don't think that ordinary, everyday folk like me, are supposed to understand what the hell is going on in this movie because I certainly didn't. I got the main jest of the film but the Nasa jargon went way over my head. Its also really long and I struggled to keep my eyes open, especially when there floating around space talking about things I haven't got a clue about. The main concept of the movie is that a bunch of Nasa boffins want to save the humans species by making them live in space because they can't see a long existence for humans on earth. McConaughey plays the main pilot on the space mission and he leaves his 2 kids behind to try and save humanity. Sounds simple but there are so many other elements which just made the movie confusing. In true Inception style, Nolan went way overboard with the storyline and he could have easily taken out an hours worth of footage. The beginning and the end were interesting but the main space mission was quite boring, until Matt Damon pokes his head out of the woodwork. For a Nolan film, I thought that it looked pretty basic, especially with such a big budget, but you do end up sticking with the plot because you want to see if he gets home. The ending also didn't make much sense to me because I really don't know how Hathaway was able to build a house in the middle of nowhere.

I think the film tries to explain this away with ""we are working in secret, people wouldn't support the space programme"". This is wrong in a million ways, from the fact that secretly building habitable space stations can't be harder than sending secret missions to travel through a wormhole around Saturn, to ""people should have probably realised the world is ending so hey, THEY JUST MIGHT SEE THE LOGIC HERE"", with a stop in ""who cares what they think, we never intend to save them anyway"".

 movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment I've 
 experienced from cinema in years. I give 1 star to bring balance to the 
 current rating, in reality this movie is of course not that bad.
 
 The whole idea behind the plot is that McConaughey ended up in this 
 blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and 
 stuff, and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his 
 daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity. So what 
 in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of 
 events McConaughey ended up inside this blackhole. All this was 
 apparently the result of a bigger plan all along. Was there really no 
 easier way for (future humans/aliens) to transmit this data, and if 
 they built this time-space warping machine inside the blackhole - means 
 they had access to the data all along? And also means they chose 
 McConaughey daughter on purpose? So I don't understand, what was this 
 purpose? Could they not have connected their portal to professor's 
 office a long time ago, or go for one of the ten billion more rational 
 alternatives?
 
 On a side note: is it not funny how McConaughey ignored the message NOT 
 TO GO from the same 'ghost' yet followed the rest of the directions? 
 While in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble 
 attempt. Had he added 'it's you dad' or any other sensible hint he 
 would have saved his daughter years of suffering (and maybe a lifetime 
 for himself when he realises this). And I don't even want to get into 
 how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on 
 the watch, which was unaffected after being picked up, meaning it was 
 hardly gravitational manipulation was it? What was the point of trying 
 to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then. If he could 
 do that, he ought to have found a better solution that did not require 
 his daughter 25 years to figure out.
 
 And anyway, they saved humanity by building this massive station named 
 after his daughter (by that time they knew what he went through and 
 they still named it after her?). Why couldn't they have done the same 
 thing on Earth? Just build the same goddamn station on Earth without 
 needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t, bam, humanity 
 saved in the same way.

",".Back to the Future, reloaded with a bigger budget INTERSTELLAR: viewed at Berlin Sony Ctr. Cinemaxx, FEB. 2015-- Cutting edge pseudoscience from Christopher Nolan. Nolan is noted for making wannabe sophisticated big budget big star films with big special effects that bedazzle the masses but don't hold up to serious scrutiny. interstellar is a perfect example. In this one Nolan plays around with advanced notions of theoretical physics and cosmology such as Einstein's Space-Time Relativity and wormholes leading into parallel universes. To lend authority to this exalted eye-over wool-pull he has consulted with noted Cal Tech physicist Kip Thorne, the go-to scientist for serious reflection on wormholes and possible other universes. What emerges is a pot-pourri of cutting edge wild ideas not too convincingly thrashed through the cosmic mix-master and coupled with a Back to the Future Midwest farm family back story that is mildly entertaining if you don't think about it too hard and just call it Science Fantasy, like Nolans other pictures.

9 December 2021,patrickfilbeck,1," Interstellar is the first film to show that Nolan's hype didn't do the director any good
","This incredibly overrated film is arguably Christopher Nolan's worst film - but it can be said that his films have generally been going downhill since then. A boring, inflated testimony to one's own overconfidence is Interstellar, a film that pretends to understand a lot, but in reality gets by without hope, empathy and realism. Neither the world that is going to end nor the new world, ie the world after ""salvation"", is a life-friendly environment and the same applies to the people who are supposed to find their way around it. Semireligious images underline here an unsupported science and do it no service in it. Instead, it is equated with beliefs. Human philosophy and values, closeness and affection find no place here. In addition, Nolan tells all of this in a pacing that makes you fall asleep. The dialogues are hollow and bony, but want to appear obsessively clever and ""deep"". The pictures have the need for biblical monumentality, but are annoying in their angles and tracking shots after the first 15 minutes. The characters are cold, incomprehensible and have religious martyrdom anchored in them - a disgusting affair. All in all, one can say that Interstellar is well suited for people who like to overestimate themselves and are almost sociopathically self-focused. Nolan can start there, because he is right that humanity is currently going its rigid and stubborn path in such a dystopian direction.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

His opulent screenplays paired with stunning visuals and grandiose music scores push the inconsistent characters in the background and the plot is kept ambiguous enough to never fully commit to one story and Interstellar is no different.

8 November 2014,bill0033,5," More drama than sci-fi, should have been better.
","Christopher Nolan has made some great films, but alas, this isn't one of them. It's not a bad film, but as sci-fi, it misses the target. A film about alien life forms is credible, because it's possible, but a film that mumbles abstract nonsense about a relationship between quantum data, time and five dimensions, that puts a primary character behind a bookcase to observe what's going on in front of the bookcase while unable to communicate through the books had me shaking my head. And then, in what seemed like an eternity later, in a silly and inconvenient way he does communicate. Also, I'm still wondering about the significance of the drone chase sequence. Particularly distracting was when HE rose from the pod. Maybe if I'd known he was in the movie would have prepared me for it, but it came across as an unintended joke. And the constant crying by every one of the characters was just too much. Reportedly costing $165 million to make, the money sure doesn't show up on the screen. For all the questionable raves about the effects, among other things, I wasn't wowed by them at all. A dark color palette full of dull grays was far from inspiring, as good science fiction should be and it came across on the screen as being low budget to me. Visually, it was no Oblivion. The relationships and drama between the characters is the main focus of the film with space and time travel serving only as a device to advance and put some quirkiness into that plot line. As I said, it's not a bad film. Without the lofty expectations of seeing top notch sci-fi from a great film maker, it still had some good dramatic and emotional moments that held my attention, largely because the actors threw their all into it and because Hans Zimmer's great score made some overly long sequences seem way more exciting that they were.

5 October 2019,dpg-87522,7," One of the best Nolan´s movies
","Christopher Nolan is one of those directors who do not see each day, is known and respected for the trilogy of the knight of the night and for telling his stories in different chronological order. Interstellar was a film acclaimed both by critics and by the audience, it could be said that these were the main reasons why I wanted to see it, apart from Matthew McConaughey being the protagonist. The movie has a good start, because you understand who is who and what you need to know about the main characters. The performances are as always in the excellent Nolan movies, the comrade movements seemed good to me, the environment I loved because it is not fictional, you think that what you are seeing is real. The script is great in the sense that you can understand that Nolan made him want since he even bothered to ask a professional in Astronomy to help write the script. The plot may sound something simple but it is really very complex, it would be that the characters have to find a habitable approach to save humanity from extinction, if that sounds very simple, but it is not because there is more like that mission itself was a farce and the human relationships of the characters. The relationships of the characters feel real, the movie made me feel how the characters felt, it is very emotional to see how Cooper takes his time to decide whether to go to the mission to save humanity or stay with his children in the earth, for example when Cooper is taking the mission and his daughter tries to reach him desperately, you manage to feel the sadness that the characters feel at that moment, and that is something that not many films achieve, if their realization with Murph is quite complex, you could say that the main theme of the film is love, everything is done for love, in fact you could say that love is what saves humanity, the connection between Murph and Cooper is so strong that it helps Murph to save the humanity from extinction. But no matter how emotional it is, Nolan did not make a perfect movie, since in itself, it makes no sense that a secret government organization hires a subject who has not seen in years for such an important mission, and when the characters go to the water planet and one of the characters stays on the ship, I understand that the hours spent there were 20 years on earth and on the ship, therefore I have to ask myself questions like: How the hell did that guy survive 20 years on the ship alone without losing his sanity, entertaining himself and not resorting to suicide? Did they have provisions for 20 years? Wow, that guy really deserves all my respect, for surviving that, and the truth is that something that surprised me about Nolan was that, it was very obvious those who were going to die and those who were going to live, I say they surprised me because Nolan He is a respected director for not making mediocre mistakes, if he may make mistakes in his movies, but not as mediocre and repetitive as that. In conclusion Interstellar is a film that I personally liked very much, with good performances, an interesting environment, a good direction, characters with personality, but with things that have weight for plot, which are the opposite of reality, this movie It deserves a 7/10 but I will make an exception, for the good attitudes, for the complexity of the protagonists, because Nolan took the trouble to ask for help from a professional for the script and because I am very entertained, it is because that this movie for me is an 8/10.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Switching between earth and space-scenes would destroy nearly any movie in it's flow, but with the continuity of the perfect score through this scenes, it doesn't break the storyline. It goes hand in hand showing what happens simultaniously. And that shows great dramatics. Great done! The story is one of the best i've seen so far.

How does the space team manage to get their hands on all the fuel needed to launch multiple rockets if there is not even enough food to feed whoever is left on earth. Strike two. The middle of the movie was the best part. Their journey was engaging and scientifically reasonable. The ending with Morse communication was snake oil and mirrors.

","There is science fiction, there is space opera, there is science fantasy, and there are superhero stories. The reader or the viewer needs to make a judgement about what kind of story they are in and dial the suspension of disbelief to a level that works. Is this 2001, or is this Star Wars? Once I know what kind of universe I am in I am cool and set my expectations accordingly.
Interstellar tries to be at the science fiction end of the spectrum and fails miserably. It's like watching the 1960s TV show ""Lost in Space"" except that the protagonists are idiots this time.
That is my major beef with this movie. A more minor issue is that rather than letting the camera tell the story, Chris Nolan subjects us to what seems like days of exposition which turns out to be meaningless science babble anyhow. The soundtrack is impressive only for its dynamic range. The film was shot and edited so that it only really works visually in IMAX. Good for 70mm film activism, but bad for Cinema. (The last film that touted 70mm as a selling point was ""Far and Away"". 'nuff said.)
Aside from that, Matthew McConaughey does a great job as Cooper and Anne Hathaway is more than convincing as Brand. If you can get over your anger at the first two and a quarter hours, the last 35 minutes is actually pretty good and satisfying. There are a couple of very good ideas in this film and they come to the fore at the end.
I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan as a director. Other than ""Batman Begins"" and ""Inception"" all of his other films that I have seen are outstanding, and ""Inception"" is more than good.

If you have been watching science fiction since the 1960's, this film will not present you with any new storyline. Over and over we have seen the doomsday scenario where one must find a new world for humanity. There is no contribution to science fiction in this movie. None. Zip. Nada. And the actors? I am an unconditional fan of Anne H. But here, she seems like she has no material to work with. She did the best she could. But no Oscar performance here. Matthew M., on the other hand, makes all efforts necessary to bore us to death. If I could travel through time and space, I would have skipped this movie and gone straight to the end titles. John L., whom I think is among the best actors of his generation, manages to stand his ground and comes out with his dignity of actor intact. However, a bad movie IS a bad movie and in science fiction this kind of mistake can unfortunately pass for acceptable. If you are a fan of the genre, don't bother.

The characters were farmers, it's understandable, but I quickly learned that the whole world's population has supposedly turned into farming. Yeah right. Still conveniently the father (McConaughey) used to pilot for Nasa as well, and when he suddenly finds out a hidden Nasa base, he is instantly asked to fly a spaceship into space. Just like that.

The fantastic elements of 2001 were based on superior alien technology rather than never seen before because it can't exist natural phenomena. The film attempts to make up for its total lack of viable science by using some slick space ship designs, some unusual planets and some well known actors-quite a few of them in fact. It made me think of what a crook played by John Leguizamo said in the film 'Assault on District 13': 'its fascination politics""-as in this film is about mesmerizing its audience with slickness but not really saying anything that is classifiable as decent science fiction.

The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever, and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity. I thought it sort of devolved in a kind of sentimental mess, but the presentation of the problem is worth a viewing.

","(Earlier: Trump in space: America First. Nolan brothers promised, as James Rocchi put it, ""outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Interstellar, as absolute ""A"" production, is mediocre Hollywood crap ! It fails in every department, both science & fiction, but that was never good enough reason for failure: many SciFi films failed in science but excelled in fiction and storytelling, acting, plot, details, dialogues, etc. This one was not even close to excel. I hated it's infantile basic plot premise ""love transcends the limits of time and space"",... and many embracing dialogues. Next in line is idea of faux all-American heroism, a patriotism masked as concern for ""human race"", faux American superior technology (we are left to imagine that everyone else on Earth already sank into the Dark Ages), and mythological unshakable will to go forward in the face of ultimate, apocalyptic adversity - who is better suited for ""riding"" NASA's rocket through the ""wormhole"" so that he can save the world, then white-Christian faithful farmer-engineer-pilot from Texas !? As one writer (David Edelstein) put it, ""Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, clearly wants Interstellar to be a great American epic - The Grapes of Wrath II: The New Vintage"". Eh, the amount of pathos: patriotism, family, American mythology & heroics - I was, I am, all cowed !

18 April 2015,Bruce722,7," Great potential but Nolan got in his own way... as usual.
","Interstellar is your typical Christopher Nolan film. It has an incredible score that plays throughout essentially the entire movie, beautiful visuals, an interesting and captivating plot, great acting, great character and setting development, a heavy reliance on suspended disbelief, and enormously huge plot holes. Some people don't mind them but I have trouble with plot holes so big that they actively go against what has already been established in the story arc. Forewarning, the following sentences will contain SPOILERS that are as big as the plot holes they discuss. Now I won't get into the details on every single little plot hole and inconsistency because this review would become way too long. I will, however, touch on the two biggest ones, in my opinion, and both have to do with the conclusion of the movie so again, you've been warned. The first is the complete and total fail that is the time paradox proposed in this film, more specifically the 'bootstrap' paradox. This is based on the concept that critical content that the futures hinges on is actually acquired from the future itself. Of course, this theory is a farce but unfortunately many science fiction stories rely on it as its foundation. Theoretical physicists will disagree but they're just manufacturing job security (i.e. they're liars). I won't go into too much detail on the various examples of this paradox in the film but if you see it, it'll be painfully obvious which instances I'm referring to, as they point them out for you. The second fail is the inconsistency of time relativity, as they introduce it in the movie itself. It makes sense throughout most of the film... until the end, when Anne Hathaway somehow doesn't age. Nolan apologists will fabricate arguments to defend this or make excuses, just like they did in Inception, but the reality is that Nolan blew it here. She should've aged 51 years or more just like the rest of the people (outside of Matthew McConaughey, who was sucked into a black hole and of course survived). I mainly focused on the negatives with this review because those few negatives are what held the movie back from a perfect rating. If Nolan would've gotten out of his own way, this could've been one of my favorite science fiction films ever. Unfortunately, it was pushed back to the ""really good but not great"" category where so many other films reside.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Maybe they just didn't ring true, or maybe they didn't add much to the story. Maybe (in the case of the daughter) it was just so much negative-feeling bunk that really distracted. It's too damned bad. This is a large-canvas film and it was diminished. I *think* that's because instead of infusing our characters with some nobility, we were treated to whining, and supposed realistic human behaviour. I gotta say, if you're aiming high, don't sabotage your attempt with the low human characteristics. Give us something to feel good about. This movie seems to be about people attaining their goal despite being 'merely human'. Darned shame, wasted opportunity.

","Do you remember when Chris Nolan wasn't CHRIS NOLAN!! Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were amazing examples of redefining old material and creating a world as profoundly unique as Tim Burton did in the 90's. Memento and Inception are two of the smartest, most profound films I have ever seen. But what happened with the Dark Knight Trilogy is Nolan had been stroked so much that he thinks he can do anything. He thinks everything he touches is gold and that isn't quite true. Now all that being said I am so completely confused as to whether Interstellar is yet another example of his sheer brilliance as a film maker and creative mind or if its just him thinking he's great and carbon copying other material to make some sort of deeply profound sci-fi films. It did definitely have some plot holes (though not nearly to the extent of The Dark Knight Rises or Man Of Steel) but a lot of that can be explained away using hypothetical science. It is not exactly your typical mainstream sci-fi film because it is definitely thought provoking but then you think about it too much and the film starts to lose merit. The characters for the most part are surface deep and while the film is visually stunning (as far as I'm concerned its ten times the over-hyped Gravity was visually and story wise) the story makes sense and goes from being a little out there to total science fiction/hypothetical physics.) There is a lot to like about Interstellar and to call it epic is an understatement. Nolan inflates his content to the point where there is so much good and so much bad that you're left confused as to whether you loved it or hated it so I think most people want to love it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

28 June 2018,icasilas,9," Interstellar: a true space odyssey.
","How could I describe such a beautiful picture, such outstanding performances and top notch directing? Christopher Nolan's interstellar is the year's true gem, and above the most authentic scientific experience that Hollywood has ever witnessed throughout al its long history of space films, an astonishing accuracy that was guaranteed by the now Nobel prize winner Tip Thorn. It is a true Oscar worthy masterpiece. Interstellar is a perfect mix between brilliant cinematography, staggering visual effects, and a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of astrology, and is inarguably the best picture by visionary director Christopher Nolan (I still concur to that statement in the year 2018, after 'Dunkirk ' his latest epic film, has been brought to the big screen). But let's not speak profusely about the brilliance of Christopher Nolan, for it is a universal consensus. Instead let's dwell on the real charm of this movie, the one that transcends its scientific accuracy, which is its incredible ensemble cast and their respective performances, starting by Mathew Mconaughey who made an Oscar worthy piece of acting, portraying Joseph Cooper, a widowed spacecraft pilot who struggles between his responsibilities as a father and those of the leader of earth's last hope to escape an impeding extinction, a character with so much emotion to show but in such unforgiving conditions and that only an experienced and talented actor can understand and depict. In such a dark apocalyptic atmosphere, though shot dynamically and rather beautifully by Christopher Nolan's camera, shines a persona that soaks all the heavy scientific and gripping scent of the movie into a gentle mix of hope and affection: in a time of hopelessness and fear, Amelia Brand, portrayed by the beautifully talented Anne Hathaway, disavows science in a time where can only lead to her doom and acknowledges entities that not even science can understand, human sentiments that transcend space and time. This stance, though seen by some as criminally obscene and illogical, is of the essence of this picture's philosophy, one that is meticulously explained and pictured by the beautiful imagery and clever dialogue that interstellar has more than enough to show. Another exceptional feature of this picture its perfectly timed usage of wide shots, using this to create peaceful pauses throughout the intense course of the film to silently stare to the inspiring abyss of the deep dark space, giving the viewer a sense of immersion and serenity that only a few movies succeeded in achieving.
One might call interstellar a technical masterpiece, a visual chef d'oeuvre or a scientific reference, yet its most important aspect is far more deeper in my opinion, one that supersedes the story or the future it represents: the depiction of humanity as a lonely entity in this universe and exploring our connection with it, discovering that the outcome of us being the only species even when settling in the fourth dimension is quite possible is for me very unsettling, what's most praise worthy in this marvellous picture is the question it leaves the audience with, as it is for all the pictures that Christopher Nolan has blessed us with.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

But they completely ignored tidal gravity, meaning in an intensely strong gravitational field, such as near a black hole's event horizon, or crossing it, the force is so strong that it will pull the nearer side of an object much more than the far side, thus tearing it apart down to the atomic level well before reaching the event horizon.

","With 169 minutes runtime, this is the longest Christopher Nolan feature and one of the longest movies I've ever seen. In the beginning, the whole idea of some ""end of the world"" could be seen as a cliche, but taking into regard that Nolan always offers us something that's original, or narrated in a unique way, it probably has a good explanation and an unexpected turn of events. Which it does. As someone who's watched many films about space, it was rather fun and interesting to see taking it to a new level. There's an emotional aspect of father having to leave his family in order to save humanity, which may be distressing and disturbing to many. I am not saying the movie is bad. In fact, probably one of the best movies with this thematic. It is just that at some points it felt overlong and unnecessary (maybe there are people who saw this as an almost 70 year long movie, so I can't blame them either), especially the dialogues. However, the duration sometimes is justified by spectacular shots and well-executed CGI, which is rather fascinating in itself, despite the plot. There are also some scientifical parts which are sometimes hard to follow, and I read more about some things I wasn't quite sure about, sometimes finding them described and explained completely differently than what's shown in the movie. However, one cannot blame the director for that, since many in the audience probably don't understand the subject completely. It was explained reasonably. The ending confused me a bit, which is also why I was slightly dissatisfied after finishing this movie.

","I saw the poster for this film long before its release, and it was billed to be a big blockbuster, the success of space movie Gravity probably helped the hype, directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception). Basically, in the near future Earth is facing the extinction of the human race due to drought, famine and extreme climate change. Widowed former science engineer and NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow) and lives with teenage son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and ten year old daughter Murphy ""Murph"" (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn's Mackenzie Foy), she believes her room is haunted, the ""ghost"" she and Cooper discover is communicating through gravitational waves, leaving binary coordinates in dust. These coordinates direct Cooper to a secret NASA installation led by Professor John Brand (Sir Michael Caine), there may be hope for the human race to survive; a wormhole, created by alien intelligence, discovered in the further reaches of the solar system, leading to another galaxy, surrounding the black hole Gargantua three potentially habitable worlds have been identified, named Miller, Edmunds, and Mann, after scientists who surveyed them. Cooper is recruited to pilot the spacecraft Endurance to explore these planets, if one of them can sustain life then humanity will follow in space stations, but this means he will be away from home for many years, but this mission is important, Murph is devastated by his departure, they part on bad terms. On Endurance, Cooper is joined by Brand's biologist daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), scientists Romilly (Cloud Atlas's David Gyasi) and Doyle (American Beauty's Wes Bentley), and robots TARS (voiced by The Grinch's Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart), the scientists go into hibernation while the craft travels towards the black hole, once close they awake and try to withstand the turbulent effects. The first head to planet Miller, but it being so close to Gargantua means it experiences severe gravitational time dilation: every hour on the surface is seven years on Earth, it is inhospitable, being covered by shallow ocean that experiences enormous tidal waves, Amelia tries to recover data, but Doyle is killed and departure is delayed, returning to the shuttle Cooper and Amelia find 23 years has passed. Back on Earth, adult Murph (Zero Dark Thirty's Jessica Chastain) is now a NASA scientist assisting Brand with his equation to enable NASA to launch the massive space station, near death Brand admits he already solved the problem and determined it is an impossible project, he covered this up and put faith in ""Plan B"": using fertilised embryos to start humanity anew, however Murph says the equation could work with additional data from a black hole's singularity. The Endurance only has enough fuel to visit one more planet, after a tense vote they decide Mann is best, however landing they find it is icy and inhospitable, they do however find Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) in hibernation, awoken he tells everything he knows about the mission, he knew ""Plan B"" was the true goal, he faked data to be rescued. In a moment of madness Mann breaks Cooper's spacesuit visor and leaves him to die, fleeing to Endurance on a shuttle, Romilly is killed by a bomb Mann planted, Amelia rescues Cooper and they get to Endurance, just as Mann docks improperly and causes the airlock to explode, serious damage is caused, but Cooper gets Endurance under control using the shuttle. Nearly out of fuel Cooper and Amelia plan to slingshot Endurance around Gargantua towards Edmunds, Cooper sacrifices himself with TARS to collect data on the singularity, detaching into the black hole and propelling Amelia by dropping the ship's mass, Cooper and TARS enter an extra-dimensional ""tesseract"", where time appears as a spatial dimension and portals show glimpses of Murph's childhood bedroom at various times. Cooper realises the alien beings may be human from the future who have constructed this space for him to communicate with Murph and save humanity, the coordinates from previously were in fact Cooper himself, finding adult Murph in the ""tesseract"" he uses gravitational waves to encode TARS's data on the singularity into Murph's watch, with this she solves Brand's equation and the process of evacuating Earth begins, the ""tesseract"" is closed and Cooper ejected from Gargantua back into the Solar System near Saturn. Time dilation from the entire mission means that humans have evolved to become an advanced space faring race, Cooper is found by a space police vehicle before his oxygen level drops, he wakes on-board ""Cooper's Station"", he explores the alternative world, and he reunites with elderly Murph (The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn) who led the exodus of humanity, she advises Cooper and TARS to search for Amelia, who has begun preparation on the planet Edmunds. Also starring Casey Affleck as adult Tom Cooper, Spider-Man 3's Topher Grace as Getty, The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as School Principal and William Devane as Williams. McConaughey holds it together well as the forthright pilot into space, Hathaway is good being informative, Chastain does well as the angry but important daughter, Damon is a welcome surprise, and Caine gets his moments as the wild old man. The majority of the film has similar scale and vision to 2001: A Space Odyssey, utilising fantastic special effects for spectacular visuals and extra-terrestrial worlds, I can see elements of Silent Running as well, it does get soppy towards the end with a concept like Contact (coincidentally also starring McConaughey), but overall it is a majestic space film with plenty to offer, including heart, a worthwhile science-fiction adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Music, Original Score for Hans Zimmer, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Production Design, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Original Music, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

","Seriously? Some people are rating this 10? I'm no physicist but I do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility. Firstly, the first line of the synopsis of this film on IMDb. Scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? What? Sorry,but no. On our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world. Even North Korea. They're being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature. Also, we can grow vegetation without sunlight. There are many people doing this today. So why, if for any reason, would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? This is just the first problem I have with this film. At no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was. I want to know, and I waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came. Secondly, forgoing the wormhole, if gravity is that strong to slow down time, you'd be crushed, and waves wouldn't even exist. Let alone 100 foot waves. Thirdly, the robot. Why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? Throughout the film the same joke. Humour level at 75%? Sarcasm rating at 80%? Oh yes these ""jokes"" came thick and fast. The only joke I could see is that this film was actually made and I wasted 3 hours of my life. If you want to watch a brilliant sci fi, with Matthew Maconaghy, watch Contact. It was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist, Carl Sagan. Now that's worthy of a 10. The only good point about Interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack.

It's probably my personal favorite film because the concepts it explores are already extremely interesting to me but we finally have a modern film that captures it so gorgeously and realistically. It has an incredible blend of practical effects, there's homage to scifi classics in the score, characters, and cinematography that gives the film an aesthetic that feels masterful, and classically familiar. The sheer scope of the endeavor is captured perfectly through every actor at every instance. Again this film can be draining but it's equally inspiring. I give it 9 because there are a few themes that toward the end make the film seem convoluted. Sure it comes full circle and makes perfect sense in the end, but the significance of love being equally important to gravity and non linear time, or in Anne's eyes the driving factor to this endeavor being inevitably completed, sidelines the brilliance of the daughter Murphy, and the will of Matthew that allowed the non linear time construct to guide them to inevitable survival.

Where 2001, Robert Zemeckis' Contact (which also cast Matthew McConaughey), and Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity used solid science as a launch for deeper philosophical musings, Interstellar begins with ersatz science and degenerates from there. The premise that a planet orbiting a black hole would be a suitable place to relocate Earth's population (after Earth's environmental collapse) is a fatal flaw. Black holes radiate powerful, deadly radiation, and everything circling around them are inevitably sucked closer and closer into the black hole's crushing gravity. Somehow, the hero (""Cooper"") gets himself inside the black hole unharmed, where he sees myriad display screens of himself at various times in his life. And somehow he sends his past self a message. The illogic of that circular logic (ignores first cause) breaks the entire arc of the storyline, such as it is.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
10 November 2014,Vishal_s_kumar,10," Beautiful to behold
","Christopher Nolan is a director whose name has, quite literally, become synonymous with realism. The Nolanisation of cinema, which made the gloomy streets of Gotham a bridge between the fantastical and the commonplace, now grounds countless fancies within the mud of our reality. With Interstellar, arguably his first 'true' science-fiction project, Nolan inverts expectation once again, with a film rooted in the mundanity of maths homework but spliced with the fantastic. Opening, tellingly, on a dusty model of the shuttle Atlantis, the film's near-future setting sees humanity starving, squalid and devoid of hope. Eking out an existence in a post- millennial Dust Bowl, Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and his two children — ten year-old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and her older brother Tom (Timothée Chalamet) — lead a life of agrarian survivalism (while, hearteningly, still reading a great many books). But in Cooper we find a new man cut from old cloth: an all-American hero pulled straight from Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff. Played with a drawling, Texan swagger underpinned by startling emotional depth, he is Nolan's most traditional lead to date, embodying the wide- eyed wonder of the director's youth; a man for whom we are ""explorers and pioneers, not caretakers"", who casts his lot among the stars as the human race's last, best hope. With the ailing Blue Planet left behind, Interstellar shifts smoothly into second gear. The black abyss rolls out like Magellan's Pacific; an unknowable frontier, final in a way that Roddenberry's never was. According to co-producer Kip Thorne, the spherical wormhole (it's three-dimensional, obviously) and the spinning event horizon of the film's black hole (named Gargantua) are mathematically modelled and true to life. Sitting before a 100-foot screen, though, you won't give a toss about equations because Nolan's starscape is the most mesmerising visual of the year. Gargantua is as captivating as it is terrible: an undulating maelstrom of darkness and light. Like the Hubble telescope on an all-night bender, this is space imagined with a dizzying immensity. The planets themselves are no less spectacular. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (replacing Nolan regular Wally Pfister) captures the bleak expanse of southern Iceland as both a watery hell with thousand-foot waves and an icy expanse where even the clouds freeze solid. You'll have to park yourself in front of the biggest screen available to fully appreciate the spectacle. In contrast to the grandeur of space, the ship itself is a scrapyard mutt. Modular and boxy, the Endurance looks like an A-Level CDT workshop, with no hint of aesthetic flourish or extraneous design. Ever the practical filmmaker, Nolan has constructed a functional, utilitarian vessel. Its robotic crew-members, TARS and CASE, are '60s-inspired slabs of chrome; AI encased in LEGO bricks that twist and rearrange to perform complex tasks with minimalist efficiency. Beneath Interstellar's flawless skin, the meat is bloodier and harder to chew. The science comes hard and fast, though Nolans Christopher and Jonah shore up the quantum mechanics with generous expository hand-holding. Astrophysics is the vehicle not the destination, however, and Interstellar's gravitational centre is far more down to Earth. Interstellar scales the heights and plumbs the depths of humanity, pitting the selfish against the selfless, higher morality against survival instinct. As Cooper, scientist Brand (Anne Hathaway) and crew draw closer to their destination, complications require tough decisions; the sanctity of the mission wars with the hope of a return trip. That the undertaking isn't quite as advertised doesn't come as a shock, but the cruelty of the deception lands like a body blow. Nature isn't evil, muses Brand, the only evil in space is what we bring with us. When Interstellar began life back in 2006, Steven Spielberg, not Nolan, was the man in the cockpit; a presence still felt in the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The betrayal of a child abandoned is potent from the outset but the guilt is magnified tenfold when the Endurance's first stop, within the influence of the black hole, means that a few hours stranded planet-side result in two decades passing back on Earth. Cooper's tortured face as he watches his family unspool through 20 years of unanswered video missives is agony, raw and unadorned. Beneath everything else, this is a story about a father and his daughter, the ten-year-old giving way to Jessica Chastain's adult in the blink of a tear-filled eye. With the endless pints of physics chased by shots of moral philosophy, Interstellar can at times feel like a three-year undergraduate course crammed into a three-hour movie. Or, to put it another way, what dinner and a movie with Professor Brian Cox might feel like. The final act compounds the issue, descending into a morass of tesseracts, five-dimensional space and gravitational telephony. It's a dizzying leap from the grounded to the brain- bending that will baffle as many viewers as it inspires. Inception posed questions without clear answers. Interstellar provides all the answers — you just might not understand the question. This is Nolan at his highest-functioning but also his least accessible; a film that eschews conflict for exploration, action for meditation and reflection. This isn't the outer to Inception's inner space (his dreams-within-dreams are airy popcorn-fodder by comparison), but it does wear its smarts just as proudly. Yet for the first time, here Nolan opens his heart as well as his mind. Never a comfortably emotional filmmaker, here he demonstrates a depth of feeling not present in his earlier work. Interstellar is a missive from father to child; a wish to re-instill the wonder of the heavens in a generation for whom the only space is cyber. Anchored in the bottomless depths of paternal love, it's a story about feeling as much as thinking. And if the emotional core is clumsily articulated at times, it's no less powerful for it. Brainy, barmy and beautiful to behold, this is Stephen Hawking's Star Trek: a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Attention: there might be spoilers here, but otherwise it is just not possible to discuss the film, IMHO. So do not read further if you have not seen it yet. Actually it is the first Nolan film I see, and I am open-mouthed at the HUGE hype preceding it. The film does not fulfill the expectations in most ways. The worst is the insufferable dialogue, which forces good actors into ineptness, Matt Damon being a particularly sad example. The whole screenplay needed about twenty (thousand) revisions more. There are characters that are completely superfluous, so much that one gets killed without any repercussions in the plot at all. And they do not seem to have a use for the character Romilly, either, except getting older. The idea of the NASA chief being a villain is preposterous; why send people on a mission you know they are going to fail? And his own daughter? Since it is all secret, which gallery would he be playing to? (and mind you, Caine is one of the very very few convincing characters, the other ones being Ellen Burstyin and the robots). There are huge scientific errors too, in spite of Kip Thorne. To slow time so much in the water planet, the gravity would have to crush the astronauts in essentially the first instant. A solution would have been to have the planet (or the ship) move nearer the speed of light, but apparently nobody thought of that. Points are about as subtle as a kick in the stomach, and I fail to see why anybody would think the science is ""dense"" and the film is ""complex"". Special effects are good. of course, but not as much as the hype says. And, sorry, if you get near a black hole, you would be thinned out like spaghetti by the enormous gravity. It is just impossible not only to survive, but to get out. The ""They"" is just a ""Deus ex machina"" to save the main plot from its own inepcy, and since this is all supposed to be so scientific, their appearance in the plot is completely arbitrary and illogical. And what, pray, would be these ""quantum data""? Since the quantic theory applies only in extremely small dimensions, why go look for it in space?. Somebody thought it sounded cute, I guess. There was no need to be realistic and scientific if we are getting out of the mire by miracle. The ending is maybe the best part, at times moving, but the notion that somebody who has been in hospital and will be let out only in ""a couple of days"" can rush to a rocket and take off, without space suit, raining, or assistance, as if it was a bicycle, seems ridiculous.

22 January 2015,keyope,6," Entertaining but flawed
","I thought this film was very watchable and entertaining. At times it's brilliant but at other times it's cringeworthy. Some of the dialogue and forced conversations were straight out of a B Movie. What really bothered me though is that there are some extremely technical conversations that make no sense to the average person and they go on for 5 minutes. At other times there is no explanation for what is happening and I sat there frowning and wondering what was going on. But then some of the obvious plot points were massively over-explained. And then there's the glaring plot holes. Matthew Mcconaughey finds a secret NASA base near his house and when they find out he used to be a space pilot they ask him to fly their new mission for them. So a day later he's on his way into space after a quick ""see ya kids"". This gave the screenwriter the opportunity to use him as the dumbo who constantly asks his crew mates what's going on. I mean, how on earth did a trained NASA pilot not know anything about black holes or wormholes? Don't even get me started on the bit where Matt Damon showed up. Overall this has some magnificent special effects, a few great moments of tension and emotion and some smart plot twists. But because it's all played out so seriously it makes the glaring mistakes stand out. It's like watching the last ever episode of the 70's Battlestar Galactica ""The Return of Starbuck"", but at least that show knew it was a bit of fun. This takes itself very seriously, but it has a talking robot in it that looks like a vending machine. Nuff said.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","For a Nolan film, heavy on the drama side.
This film is not as heavy on the thinking side of things, as it is more a story about the love between a father and daughter.
The plot was interesting and fairly easy to get, but it followed the typical ""looking for another habitable planet"" plot as seen in many space films. Not saying I didn't, it was great. The whole ""fifth dimensional"" and time travel aspects of it were intriguing. (I'm a sucker for endings of movies which reveal holes earlier in the movie, which you can only understand by finishing the movie).
Probably one of my favorites from Nolan, not to mention GORGEOUS.
Matthew McConaughey is phenomenal, it's difficult to complain about him in really any of his films. The side characters were solid, Anne Hathaway delivers in a not-so-huge role but she's still there.

There is enough material here for an epic sci-fi, a drama, a supernatural thriller, and an action movie. And that's a bit too much.

Like Prometheus (but somehow worse), this film had the adverse effect of inducing laughter in anybody who wasn't blinded by the interplanetary special effects. In almost all sci-fi films, there is an enormous twist in the plot or story that will strive to inspire a gasp in viewers. Some rare films have this effect with an excellently crafted twist... Not this time. The 'twist' in this film was, again, so extraordinarily awful, badly thought-out and far-fetched (don't get me wrong- these films have the right to go more far-fetched than any film has travelled before, but this one was just plain BAD), I had to shout out 'come ON!' when the credits began to roll (inspiring a few more laughs there from viewers in agreement).

I don't have the time or energy to write an essay about this movie, so this will be short. It is tedious beyond belief. While Nolan wrote and directed some movies that we loved (like the Batman series and Prestige), maybe it's time for him to give it a rest and get his creativity flowing again. I am shocked that currently this movie is number 23 of all movies. I guarantee that if the general population was voting on movies, this would definitely not be beating movies like Casa Blanca, Alien, ET and many others. This is a flawed system. The movie is so bad and seems like it will never end. I feel like I need therapy after watching this depressing bit of pablum. I didn't finish watching it, as I felt like I was being tortured. My husband did (because even if he hates something, he will finish it). I sat and endured it while I tried to read. I always felt that IMDb was the gold standard for checking on a movies worth, but lately it is so far off base it's ridiculous. I'm attributing that to cult followings of certain directors and in this case, pseudo intellectuals who felt this was some remarkable story. I don't think the critics will say a bad word about him after the Batman series. I think that at some point in the future, when this movie is shown on TV, it's star rating will go down a bit after all the hoopla has died down.

","Only complaint about this movie, is for the first three quarters of the film, we have Mathew as the mumbling, southern lead, and you guessed it ( if you have ever visited the south) you can barely understand what he is saying. Between the mumbling and the accent I had to rewind his speaking parts three, four times to get what he said. It was so bad that sometimes I heard straight gibberish come out of his mouth. If I was lucky, some other actor would repeat his lines. I actually wondered if those were impromptu because the other actor knew no one would comprehend what he just said, and if we didn't, we would miss a very important part. Otherwise, this movie is near perfect. It has everything that you innately want in a film. This movie made me want to brush up on my Physics. Some of the vernacular I wish I could confirm as really making sense. I wondered if I was an Astrophysicist, if the movie would make sense or be accurate. There was one scene in particular I wished I could verify. I was a little sad to learn that Matt made the lead here. There are so many other leading men that I like better ( I think he has lost some of his humanity lately. It often happens to celebrities when they get really famous. They turn into Step-ford Wives , basically. But it's so bad , that it's hard to overcome while watching them on film. You know right after this scene that you are watching they headed to their deluxe trailer and were immensely self consumed for the rest of the day ) but he did a good enough job here that I still enjoyed the movie. This is a great movie . Don't miss it. It will make you feel good, and it's just a really great story. Nolan is amazing. I can't quite grasp the mind on that guy. He is so talented , yet has so much profound thought and just well rounded. It's so unusual to find a writer , that can write with so much diversity. He can write an action movie, a drama, a love story, a villain, a Hero, science , and faith, and all with Oscar worthy depth and feeling.

","I don't get it. This movie annoyed me on so many levels. First of all, the producers should have hired a diction coach for the actors, or they hired the wrong one. If you are going to have dialog, no matter how inconsequential or banal, at least have the actors deliver the lines without sounding like they have a mouth full of marbles. Second, why all the noise? Really, some of it was an overwhelming clatter that added nothing to the film, almost as annoying a cacophony as that in the film Armageddon, a movie I intensely disliked. Third, I do not understand all the hype about the great musical score for this film. What?! Again, like with the noise, the score was heavy-handed and way too loud. Sorry, but modern films that use methods and tools to excess to the point where the attention is drawn to the method or tool and away from the action fail to maintain the viewer's suspension of reality and consequently fail to entertain. The score should enhance the action and not compete with it. Obviously, current moviegoers don't mind having their emotions manipulated in such heavy-handed ways. Fourth, this film would have been much better with better character development and less melodrama. I wish this had been a better film and not a soap opera in space.

He is immediately put in command of this mission although he didn't even know about it until yesterday, basically because of his fame as a great pilot. The plot gets even more involved as he and his top research companion and the oddest robot ever to appear in movies attempt to visit the three planets and determine which, if any, is suitable for earthlings. The rest of the story is too difficult to explain, let alone comprehend. Just remember that quantum physics, Black Holes, time travel and the lot, like theology, are sometimes incomprehensible for many, if not most people, but it you sit back and aren't too critical about obvious non-black holes in the plot, it's an enjoyable, if longish, movie to watch.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

With a screenplay written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, it belongs to the tradition of inquisitive sci-fi, following in the path struck by Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and Roger Zemeckis' ""Contact"" (1997), seeking to explore deep space and what it holds for humanity. It would be churlish to reveal too much about what McConaughey's crew find through the wormhole, but suffice to say that the planets they do explore feel grounded in reasonable conjecture that reflects the real risks of interplanetary travel. The film in particular captures both the frightening beauty of space, courtesy of Hoyte van Hoytema's luminous, beautiful cinematography. One of the film's most powerful scenes is McConaughey watching twenty-three years worth of recorded messages sent by his children, seeing his daughter Murph grow up in a matter of minutes (played as a child by Mackenzie Foy and as an adult by Jessica Chastain), a devastating commentary on what is known as ""spacetime"".",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","With a resume including Inception, The Prestige and The Dark Knight trilogy, base expectations for each new Christopher Nolan film are unsurprisingly high. With the promise of intergalactic exploration and time-and-space-bending action, expectations for the Interstellar are even higher. Alas, Nolan proves he's human after all with a movie that is merely great, rather than his usual standard of phenomenal. There is no doubting his ambition or limitless scope though, with a powerful father-daughter story spanning multiple galaxies, dimensions and time periods. The affecting yarn at its heart is paired with a sci-fi narrative that is deep and intelligent, but occasionally hard to swallow, particularly in the final act. That it's such an effective emotional ride can also be put down to the tour de force performance by Matthew McConaughey; his devoted father who leads the interstellar mission is inspiring, flawed, genuine and eminently watchable. Sitting shotgun in the spaceship, Anne Hathaway is solid, if not spectacular, as a focused and brash astronaut, whilst back on earth Jessica Chastain is superb as a world-class scientist and 13 year old Mackenzie Foy is gripping as McConaughey's plucky daughter. Unfortunately the supremely talented Casey Affleck is not given enough to do and the surprise arrival of an A-lister halfway through feels completely out of synch and, shockingly for Nolan, could even be considered as stunt casting. There's not much to write about the breathtaking visual splendour on offer, as words wouldn't be able to do it justice. Suffice to say Nolan has outdone himself when it comes to his eye for presentation, his employment of 70mm IMAX cameras amplifying the beauty and terror of outer space. Often awe-inspiring and enthralling – but with the odd slow patch and narrative flaw across a bum-numbing 167 minutes – Interstellar is bold, brainy and beautiful, yet not the modern masterpiece that it could have been.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","There were a lot of quality films released in 2014 and, while it may not be #1, INTERSTELLAR is the most mind-blowing. As much as I loved Christopher Nolan's Batman series, I'm even more excited to see him return to his own devices. The man's got vision and I love seeing it brought to screen, and INTERSTELLAR is his jump into the world of science fiction (for the record, INCEPTION was more action/fantasy than sci-fi). This is an awe- inspiring tale of mankind's last desperate attempt to save itself from extinction. In the not-too-distant future, the world's crops have fallen victim to a new blight and food is becoming scarce. The dying crops have left the soil barren and the nation has fallen into a new era of immense dust storms. Bizarre anomalies in his daughter's bedroom lead former experimental pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to a secret base containing all that remains of the NASA space program. We discover that NASA, led by Cooper's former colleague Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), has begun an operation to try and save what is left of humanity. A wormhole appeared in the vicinity of Saturn almost fifty years ago that links our solar system to a galaxy elsewhere in the universe, and a group of astronauts were sent through ten years ago to scope out potential habitable worlds for relocation. Now it's time to see what they found. The mission: Cooper and Amelia will lead an expedition through the wormhole to investigate the planets where astronauts are broadcasting positive signals, while Professor Brand will remain on Earth attempting to solve the problem of how to subjugate gravitational forces to the point where a station containing humanity's remnants could be launched from the surface of the Earth.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interesting set up introduces us to a disintegrating near-future world.

McConaughey is the astronaut turned farmer who takes a circuitous, and somewhat unlikely, route back to being a rocket man. Interstellar tries to get the science right but quantum physics doesn't make for the best dialogue. Neither are helped by dropping the spoken track way down in the sound mix. McConaughey's tendency to speak through gritted teeth doesn't help either. Although it looks great and is often very imaginative, the film takes too much time exploring dead ends and detours. At times, it felt a bit like a very long trailer for a very epic series. And it really does seem very long, without ever settling on a unified theme.

8 April 2015,michaeleb1025,3," I tried but it failed, boringly
","So much of this film is so mediocre on so many levels that even though my young film nut friends recommended it highly, I could not muster any enthusiasm for it. I had trouble just getting through it. Maybe it was the lack of originality. When you see lighting, camera setups and set pieces borrowed from other movies you could think homage, but this piece demands complete innovation. The acting was tedious. Maybe it was the casting of a big name Hollywood bore in the lead. Maybe it was because the music was so drab and ponderous. Hans Zimmer is over used but not particularly gifted. Maybe the visuals were OK, but I did notice a space ship or two that were a little too optically printed. This movie would have benefited greatly by being created exclusively in the digital realm. Christopher Nolan's pretentious use of dead pixel film grain make the image lose intensity at times. What made 2001 a marvel in its time (also the film that this film tries to elaborate on), was the extreme precision of its image. Stanley Kubrick used the then state of the art 70mm Super Panavision and the best lenses that he could borrow or steal. In this present era 8k imaging would have helped this film attain a much finer quality that would made its other faults almost bearable. If you want to see better ""end of the world as we know it"" films, there are a great number of them that are either ludicrously fun or serious and inventive. They are a pleasure to watch compared to this tedious mess of environmentalist propaganda. If Christopher Nolan wants to keep remaking other peoples films, great. I just don't think he deserves the bloated praise some people are giving him for his efforts. I love movies about science fiction, fantasy, outer space travel and special effects. I have enjoyed movies like Pacific Rim, Kickass, Star Trek and even Avatar with its bizarre messages.

It also would have been great to be honest about hard choices and letting go of anger in favor of understanding.

","Given how much Hollywood has been obsessed with mega-budget blockbusters based on comic books or franchise films in the 21st century, it is sometimes easy to forget that certain films of other genres, made on roughly the same budgets can have an impact as well. British director Christopher Nolan's immense and philosophical 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR is just one such film. It is a film that, much like 1997's CONTACT and 2013's GRAVITY, owes a significant story debt to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, a debt that Nolan himself freely acknowledges Set in some unknown, far-flung future in which life on Earth is becoming increasingly uninhabitable due to out of control climate chaos, and where massive dust storms are commonplace, the film stars Matthew McConaughey as the chosen leader of an expedition to find new habitats for what's left of Earth's population in the vast reaches of outer space. But to do that, they will have to venture through a black hole that opened up within our own Solar System, around Saturn. They make that ultra-hazardous journey through the black hole, and find three worlds spinning along the vortex, one of which may very well support human life, and another one of which they find a survivor (Matt Damon) of a previous expedition. They are then confronted with the issues of the space-time continuum that was part of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity; and McConaughey is confronted with having left his family behind to face the apocalyptic devastation that he knows awaits him if and when he should return from the far-flung reaches of the universe. But following another trip through the black hole, McConaughey is in for an extremely big surprise, one as much inspired by The Twilight Zone as anything else.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

I found myself and my aunt continually saying to each other ""What did he just say"". And she couldn't tell me nor could I tell her. Matthew McConaughey especially spoke to low, he seemed to mumble a lot and let his voice drop to a whisper as he was speaking. We left saying ""What just happened, what was this movie about"". I think if we could have understood everything they said we could have gotten something from the movie. Sometimes the sound effects drowned out the dialogue.

Kubrick avoided most of the science talk, and created an artistic expression of the space-and-time mystery. That's why ""2001"" will remain a masterpiece and why ""Interstellar"" will be soon forgotten. And the movie is also painfully slow, 168 mins, most of which are spent on closeups of McConaugh and Hathaway, with or without space helmet as well as worn and rusty space equipment, as if that would make it look more real...",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen.

","There always comes a time when children have to leave their parents. As children of the Earth, human beings may someday have to face a terrifying decision: leave mother Earth in search for a new home, or remain here to die. In the film Interstellar, mankind approaches this crossroad when the very dust of the Earth turns against us: a bleak future that mirrors the dustbowl, but on a global scale. As the film goes on, it becomes apparent that, thanks to the valor of the characters, we will not ""go quietly into the night."" Space opera films are slow-burners by nature, and Interstellar is no exception. Although it runs more briskly than most, it still takes its time with the narrative. The first act is dedicated solely to the Earth-based drama (a bit along the lines of like The Right Stuff), which sets the scene and the necessity for the mission that follows. Once the characters reach space, the film's visual splendor emerges, offering stunning views of Saturn, of wormhole travel, of far-away planets, and more. The conflicts are subtle, but they come to a full boil towards the end, before the film delivers a really bizarre reality-bending twist. The denouement is ultimately satisfying, although it does leave off with a few loose strands that the audience will have to reconcile on their own.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

I felt that the second act was a bit flawed in terms of scripting and directing (imo the weakest of the 3 acts), but is still fantastic nonetheless.

12 May 2015,Necroambulant,10," Lives Up To the Hype
","I wanted to watch it a few times before finally formulating a coherent review of Interstellar. On its head, of course, it was one of the most visually stunning and brilliantly executed collection of special effects I've been fortunate enough to see in a movie. It's an exceedingly long movie and still packed to the brim with high concept science fiction and character study to the point that it feels like they might have shoved too much into it...so I wanted to really take a bit more time to mull it over before putting my opinion out here. The science behind even the more extreme elements of the movie is actually quite sound, at worst the filmmakers could be considered guilty of extrapolating a bit too far afield from the substrate of existing scientific knowledge and technological advancement...but that doesn't make for implausible narrative devices like those that exist in a lot of high concept science fiction. Also unlike a lot of high concept science fiction, this story is one that devotes a great deal of time to the characters and character development in response to intensely unusual and stressful situations. It certainly can't be said that the individuals populating the movie were in any way two dimensional, which was a refreshing thing to say the least. If you happened to enjoy movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey​, Gravity, and Sunshine, you are almost certainly going to enjoy this movie. There are clear elements that are either inspired by those works or at the very least serving as kindred spirit to aspects of those movies. Spoilers follow: The only part of the movie that I felt was a bit contrived and silly was the little pocket universe within the black hole that allowed for the protagonist to send messages back in time which served as the impetus behind the bulk of the narrative in between. Sadly, that same recursive element was predictable enough that I could see it coming from the moment the ""ghost"" was provided as a narrative device, the only thing I didn't have worked out was precisely how it was going to be achieved, until the black hole was referenced and it all became quite clear.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was probably the strangest movie I saw this year for me. The reason is that, for every moment that was amazing and had a lot of impact, there was also and incredibly mind boggling scene or plot point thrown into the mix. But I'll go into more depth about that later. So, whats the story of Interstellar? The story is that the world is kinda bad now, since there dust-storms happening all the time, the only food Earth can produce now is corn. So an engineer played by Mathew Mcconaughey is sent by NASA on a space exploration mission to find another planet that is more habitable. But the engineer still has a family and has to say good bye to them before his big expedition. He then travels through other galaxies with other characters, one played by Anne Hathaway and a robot named TARS who kinda looks like Hal 9000 if he could walk. Well that's just the basic story anyway. If I told anymore it would just be a spoiler. First lets talk about the good things. The acting in this movie is really good, everyone seemed to play there parts well. for the most part. There were some emotional scenes that were done incredibly well with the acting and how it was shot. That's another thing, the movie was shot incredibly well. There were some scenes in the movie that reminded me of Gravity or 2001: A Space Odyssey with the cinematography. The soundtrack also helped create an amazing atmosphere of outer space. Again, reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now the best thing about the movie for me was the special effects. Oh my gosh, these effects were amazing. There were so many scenes that helped build the atmosphere of the planets the characters went to, so much so that I felt like they were really on a different planet and not some green screen over some random set. The use of practical effects were also done beautifully. The scene where they were flying the little ship felt like they were really flying. That was all my positive thoughts on the movie, so now time for the bad. But first..",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are some undeniably striking images in Interstellar, but far to often they are accompanied by silly grandiose dialogue and there's some questionable plotting throughout - the film definitely bites off more than it can chew, but there's enough good filmmaking and spectacle on display to get through the bumps along the way. Once in space, our leads have a few planets to explore to see if they are hospitable for human colonization and due to questionable plotting, the first planet they choose is the most threatening to their mission. Each hour on the planet is about 7 years on earth and of course, this is presented as a dramatic narrative countdown clock device and human stupidity all but ensures something will go wrong. Anne Hathaway's character foolishly wonders out in search of data until it is too late and finally a robot is sent after her and grabs her in seconds. Why the robot wasn't sent out to begin with so they don't burn time is a lazy ploy to up the dramatic stakes. This is soon followed by a dialogue exchange of what planet to explore next and Hathaway's love is on one planet, so naturally they decide to explore the other. With these people out to save mankind, it's amazing they made it past the moon without compromising the mission. What follows, should be left to the viewer to discover without giving away anything. However, the last act is a very watchable mess - a bizarre mix of sentiment and odd imagery that doesn't work.

So, a 2nd display of spinning debris in the cosmic emptiness in 12 months, while trying to make this cinematically thrilling and engaging denotes some sort of gumption, not that Hollywood haven't seen that kind of FX sequeling so many times. Let's say that making movies in 2014 about stuff in space is not easy, in a space where sound waves don't travel and silent movies are long extinct for a reason. Interstellar however is not a very quiet movie at all, lot of vibrating spacecraft and gripping soundtrack as fillers. Kubrick got that right back in 68 using the Blue Danube to keep us connected to the scenes that everyone ever since used as textbook on any extraterrestrial imagery. Nolan is telling a very simple story in a not very precise and confident rendering, adding several disjointed mini-stories in the main one, and ending it with the grand reunion of all characters that have not died explicitly on screen after 2 and a half hours and basically telling the world that time travel is possible and it will be soon available at a farm near you.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Not going to list all the fake, unbelievable events and happenings in the movie, you can read it in other 1 reviews. Have to say most of the public who find it amazing are dumb@sses who have no clue about science or even how to put together a good story. Don't even try to understand what's happening because it doesn't make sense and it's obvious the writer doesn't have a monkey about space and stars. Who is this Nolan to write script about this topic? Is he educated in space science? Did he even contact some professors before he put together his dumb ideas? Absolutely not believable, and boring, and annoying, and etc. One of the worst crew I've seen in terms of chemistry or even regarding individual performances. Matthew looked horrible throughout the whole movie AND ORANGE. Looked funny next to Anne with her white pale skin. Anyways Matthew is not a person who is pleasant to look at for 2-3 hours. He aged quite badly, would never believe he had anything to do with science in his life. His square head and orange skin plus the wrinkles were sooo annoying. Not much actor quality either. Anne Hathaway tried to look like a 13 year old boy and she never looked more ugly. Never expected much actress performance from her but she didn't even need it as her role was what? Crying? Haha. Jessica Chastain is usually great, but even her reactions were forced, her face was ugly and just annoying. I could say this about everybody else except maybe for Casey who was the only one believable in his role. Funny enough he played an abusive character. The make up, hair, looks, were horrible for everybody. The space environment.... looked seriously plastic and so so cheap. Obviously very low quality did not believe for 1 sec they were in the space.

Ultimately Im really disappointed in the quality of the audience as if this is what they need and what they value as 10, then there's really something horrible happening to our planet and maybe we don't need to be saved!

",I love sci-fi thrillers and all. I hated this one. There is something fundamentally wrong with this movie. The story reads as an excuse. An excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes. The film tried so much that ended up failing in everything.

","Nolan's latest is an epic science fiction drama on space travel that will make your brain freeze for some time! However, it is marred with a melodrama, Nolan is not a champion of. Earth has lived off its resources and is on brink of collapse, when Cooper (McConaughey) accidentally discovers a gravitational anomaly and lands himself at a secret NASA site, which appears odd altogether. Thereon Cooper sets on a space exploration, with little hopes of returning back. Till the exploration begins, the movie has a curious wait and frankly it stretches too far. The most interesting part is the space exploration with a spectacular imagery, VFX and screenplay. Nolan manages to pull off a highly captivating second half refusing to let us think anything else. The directorial imagination is one of the best which completes a scientist's dilemma's in a fictional manner. The performance and background score makes the movie even more exciting. However, Interstellar misses a 9/10 because of juxtaposing melodrama with science fiction. Hugely inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar does not come close to being a classic like it. Interstellar does makes us feel inspired and bewildered at the scope of mankind imagination and the mysterious cosmos. The concept of 5-dimensional quantum mechanics involving time and gravity has been explained in a remarkable fashion and makes you connected to the plot at all times. Nolan is himself the story-writer of Interstellar. The movie ends in an identical manner to Inception, where two separate stories are intermixed with a thrilling conclusion.

It's just that I don't think they should make me vomit my brain out of my skull. The droning, overbearing-soundtrack featured everyone's favorite instrument: The Dial-tone-xylophone-pipe-organ-flute. This usually hung on one note in a very high pitched whine, or, if you were lucky, it would be featured in a cord that replayed over and over again. Not just replaying though, but getting louder and louder over time, so loud that one might seriously consider burying their face in molten lava, if only to escape the assault on one's ears.

Other than Christopher Nolan stalkers loving from afar, this movie is a 3 hour exercise in endurance. Once I start to watch a movie, even for all of the faults I may find, I typically watch to the end...only with Interstellar it just wouldn't end. It was torture. I'm a huge believer that sci-fi movies are fantasy, an escape from the every day, a time to allow the improbable to take over...but they still have to make sense. The disconnect from scientific theory in this movie is of epic proportions. For example, I couldn't get over the complete avoidance of event horizon as the film wrapped up. I found myself completely irritated by this because the film relied so much on general relativity to develop the story line, and then just bastardized the entire premise of the theory so that the main character could survive was a total rip off. The acting was so over the top it was, at times, comedic. The character development was so poor that, as an example, I have no idea what Topher Grace's role even was, I was just like, ""hey, Topher Grace is in this movie""? Given the fact that the viewer was offered the opportunity to visit a different GALAXY, it was a total snoozer to see that all that is out there is Waterworld, Iceland and the Grand Canyon.

","OK, my first IMDb review. I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I love Nolan's work and I'm a science fiction fan. Sadly within an hour I was wondering if I could stick out another two hours. The actors are all great, and they get the few stars I'm willing to give it. I will admit that directing a big production like this is not for the faint-hearted and I'll give Nolan points for that. However, the story is so poorly constructed it just piles on frustration after frustration. Other reviewers on here have described the litany of illogical errors. I haven't read all 900 reviews but we have long known that black holes EAT stars and planets, and when they do, they give off titanic bursts of gamma and x-ray radiation that would sterilize entire regions of a galaxy. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief in service of just enjoying a movie, but when the entire premise is to find a more suitable home for human life and then you choose a planet apparently orbiting a black hole, well that just goes from suspension to just outright disbelief. If Batman had chosen to just use his magic freeze gun to stop the nuke in Gotham I think most Batman fans would have been groaning. That's the way someone like me feels about lazy plot devices like this. ",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","In the future, human kind is in danger of running out of food and oxygen. Therefor Cooper agrees to embark on a space journey and travel through a wormhole in order to find a new word for humanity. The thing is, I expected more from the movie. Cristopher Nolan is my favorite director and I know that he could make amazing things, but Interstaller wasn't good enough. It reminded me a little of Gravity and it was too science fiction, with many humanity dilemmas that weren't philosophized enough, with the subject of time being all too confusing and with the main idea being the bond between father and daughter rather than the future of the humanity. However that last one was a refreshing new one, as the movie didn't focus on saving the earth as many other before it have. Though, from some point, you do want it to be more than that, as it seems to have stuck on the family matter. The whole idea of the They is confusing, not to mention the ending, but this is Nolan, the guy who made Insception, so you can't expect to understand it from the first time. Maybe I have to watch it more times in order to appreciate it more. But for now a 5 for the Interstaller.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie, Interstellar was a great movie about a family of scientists who try to save the world and actually do. The story seemed to be a constant battle, always ending on a good note. The special effects of the black hole and a few of the planets was sensational. The story-line and dialogue was kept very simple and followed a very clear logical storyboard. This seemed to compel the audience and mesmerize them. Almost like being in a trance. While I sat in the IMAX movie theater in Victoria City - the whole theater with people was full and not a person moved from their seats throughout the duration of the whole movie. Furthermore, the whole audience was quiet and listened closely to the dialogue of the movie. The whole movie was captivating. I liked the simple space ships, and outfits that the space travelers wore. I also like the overall simplicity of the exploration of space. The space ships were small, the packages of left data in orange bags in the ocean were easy to be identified and everything seemed very functional and practical. This felt safe. This movie seems to have been a symbol of our future. One of simplicity externally and complexity internally. I also liked the fact that aliens were not introduced into this movie - but rather the notion of the evolved human being, being able to communicate and through new dimensions. It was a positive and happy movie about a hopeful future. One of change and one of humanity.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Interstellar is boring (it runs an hour too long), incredible (scientifically, it is asinine), ludicrous (the costars survive against all logic), and pretentious (Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck? C'mon). This film is a male fantasy in which women--Murphy, Brand--are confused and men are the problem solvers and action heroes. Anne Hathaway is made to defer throughout. McConaughey joins the space mission with zero training, and leads it, dominating scientist and astronaut Hathaway throughout, who eventually warms to him because it's in the script. McConaughey slipped through a wormhole in Contact and another wormhole in Interstellar, but his acting did not improve in the interim. But in this film, defying astrophysics, he passes through a Black Hole and survives. I mean, that is acting when he's poking around the other side of the bookcase beyond the event horizon. That scene is high comedy. In two days I am going to complete a work in progress, a novel. My story is about artists, but it has a prominent space component.

","Having made his mark in cerebral explorations and superhero adventures, director Nolan takes his unique talents to sci-fi odyssey in this gripping and thought-provoking story of hope, survival, and love. In an unspecified future, Earth has become an agrarian society without formal government structure and little time left to sustain human life. McConaughey is a former NASA test pilot-turned-farmer and father of two who becomes the ""chosen one"" to lead an expedition to the edge of Saturn when a wormhole is discovered that could be the key to finding the next habitable planet. Even with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, he's given the nearly impossible choice of saving the world or saving his own family. With a director of Nolan's ambition at work you know there'll be plenty to take in as the film boasts a compelling story, marvelous visual effects, enthralling action scenes, and the sheer strength of the human spirit; if only it didn't turn overly sentimental and revert to convention in its final act. McConaughey gives a passionate, emotionally-charged performance-one of his very best, and Chastain is also riveting as his headstrong, determined daughter; their powerful performances, along with the aid of a well-chosen supporting cast, help overcome any sloppy, melodramatic storytelling. ***",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christopher Nolan's latest film ""Interstellar"" is set in the near future where earth is facing an apocalypse. Blight has wiped out much of the planet's food supply. Dust storms ravage the landscape like the Depression-era's Dust Bowl. The only hope is a new home for humanity. Nolan and his brother John take an interesting structure on how to reveal their story to the audience. We are first introduced to Cooper (Mathew McConaughey), a widowed, former pilot and engineer turned farmer, who takes care of his two children Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and lives with his father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). He has a knack for chasing down surveillance drones and idealistic thoughts of space travel. He is a character that thinks very much outside of the box in terms of earth's future. Rather than being a ""caretaker"" for earth, he dreams of exploring new horizons. The Nolan brothers give us almost an hour's time to digest and comprehend all the characters. The film itself feels very much like a family drama with a gentle hint of science fiction. We are later introduced to NASA and learn that there is a program, which hopes to achieve planet relocation for humanity. The catch is for Cooper to partake in a journey that involves a wormhole and a severe space time continuum that may result in him not being able to return home, much less save earth in time.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Conflating galaxy-connecting worm holes with galaxy-destroying black holes is the least of INTERSTELLAR's brazen pseudo-science. Giving the Astronaut Cooper character the ability to travel back decades in time, by-passing all the Eloi-munching Morlocks, and then communicating with his daughter via a wristwatch that doesn't look very dust resistant (and which has been on a shelf all that time, in the Superbowl of Dust) may strain the belief of some viewers. Furthermore, since Astronaut Romilly knew in advance that he'd be alone in the mother-ship while his buddies were gone a decade or two, why didn't he keep the gray out by setting his sleep capsule on the ""hibernate indefinitely"" setting used by Matt Damon's ""Dr. Mann""?

I think the director did not let the actors show their craft, their range and directed them to be black and white in all instances. A waste of talent. Should have used character actors if he did not want them to work their talent. Its a serious subject and science fiction films tend to be pretentious and wooden to prove a point but the best ones like Close Encounters and The Fifth Element mix it up a lot more, not to mention Star Wars which have humor.

26 December 2014,InMyHonestOpinion,9," Stunning and real mind trip
","This is another one of those films that I have longed to see for more years than I can actually remember, I believe it was about seven years ago when I first heard about an out of this world space adventure, a couple of things appealed firstly Steven Spielberg directing another space masterpiece and second travelling through black holes. I went into this film with a very open mind knowing that the original script had been re written I wasn't too sure what to expect. I have this thing I do when I'm waiting for a particular film that has the potential to blow my mind and that is ignore it until it is released and I get to see it. A lot of the times my want and need for what I'm about to watch to be perfect destroys what it is I actually end up seeing though and I give it a half arsed rating due to letting me down so hard. This film if you are unaware has been in the works since about 2006, back then it was written by Johnathan Nolan (the Prestige, The Dark Knight) and was to be directed by Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T) Mr. Spielberg decided he'd leave the project because he couldn't find the right vision needed, since then the script has been rewritten by both Johnathon and Christopher Nolan (Inception, The Dark Knight), Christopher had a few new ideas to add to the story (no spoilers sweetie) and changed a few other ideas as well. Sometime in the near future the Earth has been devastated, global warming having a major part to play. Armies have been disbanded, no animals exist and the only real food available is corn, being a farmer is considered a very well highly respected career. Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club, Magic Mike) is one of these well respected farmers but before the dirt storms and the collapse of the world Cooper was actually an Engineer who flew craft for NASA. Cooper and his daughter Murphy played by Mackenzie Foy when young (and Jessica Chastain in later years) find secret coded messages from an unknown source, they travel to a remote base where they meet Professor Brand played by Michael Cain (The Dark Knight, The Prestige) Cooper soon learns that world is about to die and he is needed to piolet a ship through a wormhole that has been found near Saturn. A space ship has been created with the plan of flying through the found wormhole to another galaxy, a galaxy where probes have already been sent as well as other humans to ensure these planets are climatisable. Dr. Brand played by Anne Hathaway (Les Miserables, Ella Enchanted) joins Cooper as well as 3 others and they set off on their trip of a lifetime leaving all they love behind with the knowledge that someday they will return and rescue the Earth and her people. There is so much right with this movie, I'm in no way a scientific person and I'm not going to say I knew exactly what was happening but from what I could tell it all made perfect sense to me. Apparently the science behind the film is so right, well as right as it can be without having exact proof anyway. Things I have always heard like in space there is no sound is used throughout the film as well. It made it so much more real, it really surprised me how much impact it actually made to the film. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen and the score is amazing, there is no way they could have made the score any better, Hans Zimmer has excelled here. The cinematography is amazing as well, from its Earth corn row fields to the isolated icy cold sparse rocky alien worlds. I never knew Iceland where they filmed two of the planets was so gorgeous. Behind this film mostly is a love story, but not the love we have all come to expect it's more the love between a father and his kids especially his daughter and how far a man is willing to travel to ensure their safety, add to that the adventure of exploration and the sci fi of the unknown and you have a new genre. I'm going to call it ""Sciloveture"" Matthew McConaughey is once again brilliant he is really living up to his reputation of being a very fine actor, as well as his on screen younger daughter Mackezie Fox who almost steals the film from him. To be honest all the characters were likable and very believable. It's a film filled with space, science and the unknown. Please don't let that deter you from seeing this on the big screen though, as I said earlier I'm in no way smart enough to understand exactly what was being said but I guess that's what makes this film work so well I didn't need to, it all made perfect sense with everything else that happens along the way. Be sure to watch out for the droid like sidekicks as well, they bring the smiles. It has some very draw dropping moments that even put M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, The Village) to shame. Nolan has an amazing flair and talent he brings this story to live no matter what the naysayers think. Go see it although I would leave the kids behind because it does run for about 3 hours. 3 hours that flew by for me anyway, I didn't even notice the time I was that enthralled by the Nolan's world.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

For the past record all the movies blown me away and made Nolan in my favorite director's list. Knowing it's the first NOLAN movie i had watched in big screen and i am proud to share. I don't want to classify this movie under science fiction its more than that. It has emotions, love, adventure, mystery. Nolan took the best capable and needed casts for the movie, Mathew's emotional sequence, Anne Hathaway's journey for her love above horizon amazed me.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie is excellent, and it has some great special effects. The acting was also good, i got sucked into the movie right from the start, that's what i call movie-magic. There's not many movies or producers can do this so big shout-out to Christopher Nolan! I saw no flaws to the movie and the movie is very original, i haven't seen any movie like this before, the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect. The question many people ask ""How will the earth and the humans be in 100 years(or longer)"" and i like how this movie shows possibilities over what can actually happen, cause nobody has any idea whats happening in a 100 years. I also like the ""more than 3 dimensional"" talk in it, all in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch. This movie gets 10/10 from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call them ""tear"" scenes and ""joy"" scenes, it brings you so far into the movie and its great!

","I have seen this movie numerous times now, and it has reserved a special place for me. I was not very interested in science until watching this movie for the first time my freshman year in college. After watching, I was sent down a path that led me to getting a B.S. in Physics, and now I'm pursuing my doctorate in Physics. The science in this movie is not necessarily science fiction, while mostly theoretical and also Christopher Nolan taking creative liberties here and there. This movie is the brainchild of a Nobel prize winning Physicist, Kip Thorne, who worked directly with the film. The science in the film, time dilation, comes directly from Einstein's theory of special relativity and has been proven experimentally over the 100 years since its been theorized. The cinematic of the black hole, Gargantua, comes directly from Kip's theorized predictions using Einstein's general relativity equations to predict how light would behave near such a massive object. Wormholes remain unknown to exist, but are theorized. And if you fall in a black hole, it is unknown what's on the other size, perhaps a 4 dimensional bookcase, who knows.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Where to start. For a movie which has a running theme of relativity and its effect on time the first point i should make is that its far too long. It feels like three movements joined together. The second of which will leave you checking your watch and pondering if you yourself are travelling beyond the speed of light and experiencing the slowdown of time. Visually its lovely, but the wonderful scenery doesn't make up for the often heavy scientific concepts that hold the story together. We are not talking Gravity level eye candy here but its still pretty nice. I also find it frustrating that in order to help us understand the difficult concepts, the characters feel the need to explain them to each other. One would think a team of hand picked experts for a super important mission that had been sat together in a tin can for years wouldn't have had to wait to the point of seeing a worm hole to have to explain its makeup to one another. Surly there is a better delivery method for hand holding? There is a bit of action in various parts which is genuinely suspenseful and enjoyable, but like space there are vast voids of emptiness. Lets break this down. This is not a movie for Joe Blogs. If cinematography and all that shtick is your bag, you'll probably dig it.

I was skeptical going in because anything that stretches the credulity of science too far doesn't interest me. No spoilers here. I'm just going to say what many have already said. This film is based on absurd premises and I had a hard time following the plot at times. I was hoping that something extraordinary would come along to save the film, but, as others have said, it gets worse as it goes on.

","I could write about it for years without managing to describe how I felt while watching Interstellar. I am a huge fan of Nolan, whom may be the best current director: I thought I had seen his best in Inception, which already blew my mind. And then Interstellar happened. 
Firstly, everything Nolan touches becomes gold. Not only visual gold, but emotional gold when this one is priceless. Beyond the beautiful pictures, the uttely beautiful soundtrack (breathtaking use of the organ), there is this incredibly beautiful story. Interstellar is not a film about stars, skies and space, but about humanity, both its weaknesses and strenghts. It simply talks about the human condition, always wonders in a discreet way why humanity does exist and why it should be preserved : it is a hymn to mankind, almost in a religious way. The 3 hours of film pass by without us noticing, until the ends credits. Then you suddenly awake, dry your tears (I cried for half of the movie) and remain silent for a while - as even as slighly talk could destroy this emotion, endless poetry that the movie left. 
This also gives us Hans Zimmer as his best. Interstellar would be nothing without this bewitching soundtrack.
I saw very few movies like this one. It SHOULD have won the best film Oscar, as it is one of the greatest masterpieces of this century to me. Thank you, Nolan.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
26 June 2023,augusthickox,10," without a doubt my favorite movie of all time
","There is so much to say about this masterpiece. The movie has so much going on. The cinematography is just brilliant. I read somewhere that the scene with gargantua is so scientifically accurate it took 100 days to render each frame properly. A frame is 1/60th of a second. Matthew McConaughey delivers his best role i'd argue, better than in Brokeback Mountain. He has the perfect ability in this role, and his acting felt true and not fictional in the slightest. Then there is the soundtrack, which has a theme song so beautiful i added it to my playlist. This movie also has so many twists, with the Michael Caine, Matt Damon, tesseract, ""Ghost"" and time relativity. The movie was also perfectly paced, which made myself able to watch it in just one sitting, and i was fully immersed for that 2 hour and 49 minutes. Not for one second was i bored or thought ""ughh i still have another 2 hours?"" simply a masterpiece. In the past, i haven't been a huge fan of Christopher Nolans works, thinking inception and memento were trying to be too smart, and Dark Knight was just too digestible. I thought interstellar smashed both of those other categories, and is simply put the best movie i have ever seen.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
11 November 2014,strategytraining,1," Interstellar fails on every level
","Despite the hype, I went to see Interstellar hoping for the best. From the dreadful opening, which went on forever featuring insipid dialogue and portentous acting by all involved to the crude miniatures in ""space"" (clearly an homage to Kubrick's 2001, A Space Odyssey, which accomplished far more with far less technical advantages than today's filmmakers), the movie incredibly got worse and worse until the last 30 minutes with some inspired, redemptive space/time scenes. But oh, that insipid dialogue and McConaughy's western drawl and baleful looks, echoed by a truly wasted Anne Hathaway, who also walked through her lines. The real culprit is the editing, as if Nolan was so in love with his work he could not bear to cut a scene. And the music? So banal that it managed to be predictable and intrusive at the same time. I couldn't wait for the ""space scenes"" to begin. But from liftoff to deep space, they could have NASA footage instead. I just can't imagine how anyone could call the space scenes ""thrilling"" or the twists and turns of the plot ""gripping"". Whether or not you liked Gravity, at least its space scenes were in your face and hard-edged. Watching the Interstellar space station cartwheel through space like a miniature toy out of a Cracker Jacks box was simply embarrassing. The scene of McConaughy and Hathaway begging Mat Damon not to activate the airlock, because it wasn't sealed was just another example of Nolan trying to manufacture excitement. Instead of being a hoped for surprise, the result was not only something we have seen in many sci-fi space movies, but as an experienced astronaut and pilot, Damon's character would absolutely know would happen! There were so many wooden moments, it's hard to count. The best was when McConaughy walks into his sister's hospital room and the reaction from her friends and family is absolutely zero! Not even a cocked head. What a colossal waste of time, talent and money to create something so utterly unforgettable. You just can't create a profound movie by hoping characters can talk their way through it. Nolan may have had a good story in his head, but what a mess--confused, poorly plotted, no editing and a visual treatment and color palette that looks like it was done by amateurs. 1 out of 10 and that's being kind.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

It is by far my favorite movie score ever. The genius of Hans Zimmer finding such an odd instrument like the Organ, that in theory could and would never fit the tone, ends up fitting so perfectly. Matthew McConaughey gives a stellar(no pun intended) performance, only rivaled by his performance in Dallas Buyers Club. It seems like I have nothing to relate to the character of Coop, but there seems to be a universal theme that every single human can relate to within him. The feeling of dread, isolation, guilt, and the feeling of not being in control. Taking these seemingly outlandish and bizarre concepts and applying them to the human condition, is why movies like these are my favorite.

","With the Oscar nominations out yesterday, I was almost certain that interstellar would be nominated for best picture, best director and maybe best screenplay, but no. 2014 brought some great films to the screen, birdman, imitation game, boyhood,grand Budapest hotel and that's where I draw the line, other than interstellar, they were some of the best films of the year, not the best. Without doubt interstellar is the best movie made in 2014 and showcases some of Nolan a best work to date. From the visionary director of the dark knight, memento, the prestige and inception, 4 of the greatest films ever made and he is yet to be nominated for best director, even though he is, the best director, constantly achieving phenomenal films that overshadow all nominated films of the year. This wouldn't be the first Nolan film to be snubbed of best picture (I'm looking at you slum dog millionaire). I wasn't surprised that it didn't get the praise from academy members than it deserves as they are all pigheaded 60 year old men. Wouldn't be the first sci-fi film to be left out of major categories. With the exception of avatar, lord of the ring trilogy and Star Wars and inception no science fiction films have ever been nominated for best picture (gravity was science fact rather than fiction) avatar was closest to winning best picture (and should have. But they wanted to include female directors out of pity) . Let's face it, inception should have beat the kings speech, avatar should have beat the hurt locker and likewise the dark knight and et. As I was saying plenty of great sci-fi movies didn't make the Oscar cut, 2001: a space odyssey, empire strikes back, return of the Jedi, close encounters of the third kind, blade runner, Jurassic park and back to the future, while district 9 was nominated it wasn't a generic sci-fi movie. Get your act together academy and give Nolan his long awaited Oscar. In 10 years people aren't going to remember any movie of 2014 (except birdman, mainly for the cinematography), but what they will remember is interstellar, for its technical plot and accuracy toward fact rather than a bunch of cgi vomited onto a screen.

","*SPOILERS* Yes, there are times in which Nolan's latest sci-fi epic can be very scientifically inaccurate. However, he tried his best, and the end result was one of the most amazing movie theater experiences in recent years. One of the common things I've seen critics do is compare this film to 2001: A Space Odyssey. This cannot be done. Kubrick made his film about evolution, Nolan made his about saving mankind. Interstellar has so many great aspects such as the launch of the Endurance, Gargantua, and Miller's planet, it's hard to choose a favorite. This movie runs for approximately two hours and fifty minutes, and, at least in my opinion, not a single second felt wasted. I was just as intrigued in the theater as I was watching it the next two times on Blu-ray at home. Matthew McConaughey delivered a great performance, as did Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy.

","Although the visual effects are good, Interstellar (shouldn't it be ""Intergalactic""?) is just too far-fetched.

I majored in electrical-electronics engineering and physics in my 6 years of college, so I am a bit of a nerd and science stickler. When I view (or read) science fiction, to me the ""fiction"" should apply to the story, not to the science. In fantasy, the fiction applies to the science. Personally, I wish the film industry would make more realistic dramas about human space exploration. Hollywood's blockbuster profit machine abandons serious science fiction art, and, like Prometheus, made Interstellar into another action-packed CGI thriller crapper that caters to 13 to16 year-olds (the large demographic of movie going audience-$$$).

That all sounds terribly glamorous but in reality it's not, it is life changing, heart wrenching, and soul destroying to list a few, but hang in there, this tale does have an ending. Although at times the pace was a little slow, I felt it was necessary to match the speed of the story, and the passing of years.

They go there and find that it's a new NASA site. As one of NASA's best, Cooper is offered a place for the interstellar journey through a black hole in saving the human race by way of finding a new home, a new planet, for the whole species. He takes the position, despite Murphy's disagreement. He goes with Dr. Amanda Brand, Doyle, Romilly, and the robot TARS. And after fetching the Endurance module and the robot CASE, they go in through the black hole near Saturn to visit the three possible new worlds. Brand also experience the 'ghost' as Murphy did. The first world has a great time-slippage anomaly where an hour spent there equals roughly seven years on earth. Cooper and Brand argue about it, he wants to go there to finish the mission fast and go home to Murphy, while Brand rejects it due to the time slippage. They eventually go there, but immediately gets swept away by a gigantic tidal wave.

Nolan is often mentioned alongside Stanley Kubrick, the director of 2001, A Space Odyssey, but Kubrick's film has a rigorous logic that Interstellar woefully lacks. Factually is thrown overboard in the interests of storytelling and a cynical view of the audience's inability to discern what is just gobblygook from real scientific understanding.

The score was interesting but overpowering, it was hard to hear the dialogue at times. I didn't like the first ending in the black hole.

Finally, every time I think of the film my head hurts, I probably won't watch another Chris Nolan film as Inception really hurt my head when I thought about that after watching it too. Chris Nolan seems to have developed into an overbearing and heavy handed director, in Interstellar there is little grace and lightness of touch pervading what he puts up on the screen, basically I think Interstellar is a mess of a film, I did enjoy little parts of it, but that doesn't make it a satisfying film.

Entering a black hole is very possible, if you get close enough, but the only thing inside is highly compressed matter. The time dilation was interesting, until they mentioned 1 hour on a planet would equal 7 years. Time dilation requires TRAVELING (close to the speed of light). They made it seem like stopping on the planet would somehow accelerate the process. Then they manage to enter a black hole, without getting squashed like every other particle of matter and find an alien window to the past that goes to the man's daughter's room, so he can send information that will show him how to get there and then save the world. He earlier told his daughter that you ""cannot go back in time"", which is true. Then the movie contradicts him and the laws of physics in every way possible.

","War, drought and famine plague the world of Interstellar. The wars have ceased, but the fight for the basic essentials of life hang in the balance. A blight threatens the food supplies and rolling dust storms cause a dirt-filled existence for civilisation and the Cooper family. Coop (Matthew McConaughey) is a farmer who is trying to help the community and his family to survive. As a former pilot, engineer and a recent widow, he is attempting to hold together the very existence of his family. In amongst the trials of life, his daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy) comes upon a strange anomaly that leads to a series of events that push Coop into a situation that means the salvation of mankind. He is asked to sacrifice his time on the earth by going through a mysterious rip in the space-time continuum to find a new home for humanity. He and a team of scientists, headed by Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), leave earth to find new worlds that can sustain life. Once on the spacecraft Endurance, the crew is confronted with many of the realities of space travel and the nuances of traveling through time. Reminiscent of the historical accounts of early explorers of this world, they have to revert to instincts and their knowledge of the universe to determine which steps to take and what sacrifices need to be made for the salvation of mankind. Laid on a backdrop of space exploration, philosophical and moral challenges occur within the team. Being confronted with humanities biggest frailties and strengths, they have to determine who to trust and where they need to go for the benefit of humanity. Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Inception) manages to weave a web of psychological drama on the backdrop of science-fiction, reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Gravity.

","To my mind a science fiction film should be either entertaining or interesting. This film was neither. It was pretentious, long winded and boring.
If it's not going to be entertaining it should at least be reasonably scientifically accurate.
Which it wasn't.
The idea of building an Interstellar spacecraft in complete secrecy with no budget was somewhat laughable given the developmental and logistical implications of such a feat. Then to employ a retired reluctant astronaut to fly it even more so.
Later on in the story, they land on a planet so massive that the astronaut orbiting it ages 60 years whilst they are on it's surface for 30 mins.
A human being on a plant that size would be instantaneously crushed by it's gravitational forces. Not mention the fact that they left earth's atmosphere and gravitational pull on a huge rocket ship but then land and take off from this massive plant in a small shuttle craft?
Not even taking in to account how the astronaut orbiting managed to find the food, water and oxygen to survive 60 years in total isolation on a small spacecraft.
To cap it all, after travelling for what would be thousands of not millions of light years he returns to find his daughter (albeit in another dimension) happily living her life whilst he watches her through some inter dimensional bookcase.
Story line: father loses daughter, father gets daughter back again.
Sorry, I think it's a case of the emperor's new clothes.

Personally, I've watched almost every Nolan movie and enjoyed every single one I've ever seen because I like sci-fi movies, space makes me like interstellar, and in movies there are many aspects of interpersonal relationships but it's the uncomplicated relationship that keeps the movie's main focus on science. The concept of the movie is quite different from the others that I've ever seen. The relationship between time, black holes, technology of the future. It's something I never thought it would have but it is a science that is not so complicated that it makes people look confused. The story is explained and contributed to the audience to think for themselves. The movie tells of a world inhospitable due to plant diseases. Force former NASA astronaut Cooper to explore new stars to keep humanity alive. In this movie I loved the scene where a group of astronauts landed on a planet for about half an hour but when they come back the earth has been passed for many years. I find it very interesting to play science with time because there is such a thing in the real world and the scene where Cooper falls into a black hole I feel sparkling. Although in fact we don't know exactly what will happen if we enter a black hole. All of this makes it my favorite sci-fi movie of the year and I'll go back and watch it often. Anyone who is worried that they will be confused by the story or not understand can watch it at all because the texture is not complicated and when solving the clue, everyone will feel very sparkling eyes.

Interstellar is a movie that tries to teach the Children and Newbies about the theories of Einstein and Hawking in easier way (It's a fiction additionally.) and the working mechanism of Blackhole and other space particles. He demonstrated a good definition of the fourth dimension, ""Time"", but why didn't he focused much on the Murph at her dying moments, she should have a little more conversation with her father, with whom she met after a life time. other than that, the stranger than fiction demonstration of the imaginative world inside black-hole(that behind the book-self). and the unpresentable love chemistry of Cooper and Brand. I knew that Nolan would leave the story on a loose note, like he had done with Inception(the spinning totem), but i never thought even his ending would be this weak point.

","This has to be the most abysmal piece of science fiction writing of the decade. The science was absolutely pathetic - planets orbiting ""Gargantua"", a black hole, and not one, but two planets. Time dilation from being on a black hole planet. A water world with ankle deep oceans and two mile high waves. A wormhole near Saturn put in place by aliens. Earth's ecosystem collapsing because of a nitrogen-fueled ""blight"". The list goes on and on. This writing puts the ""stink"" in STINKS BIG TIME, and the authors, the Nolan brothers, are clearly intellectual midgets who appear to have spent a fair amount of time watching the Discovery Channel and understanding almost none of it. Moreover, it's completely derivative, a mimicry medley of dozens of Sci-fi themes - Black holes, worm holes, astronauts going nutty in isolation, time dilation, Earth as an eco-dystopia . . there's not one original thought or theme in any of it. It's dark and hopeless until the bitter end, when some weird trans- dimensional ""oasis"" in the middle of a black hole allows Matthew McConaughey to communicate the big secret about ""gravity"" to his scientist-daughter, who proceeds to then save all of mankind.

8 March 2017,ct021976-986-657692,6," Good idea turned wrong
","I find this film to be overrated by those that are liking it and underrated by those that are hating it, the overall score now is over 8, it is a little bit too much, other movies better than this one (for instance 2001: A space Odyssey) have a lower score and is a bit unfair that this flick is on pair or slightly over in IMDb score over that film. The cast is a mixture of good and bad, Matthew McConaughey acting, for instance, is good, Anne Hathaway so and so, Matt Damon, again, so an so, John Lithgow is OK, Michael Caine is OK (but is too old for his part, the casting is an issue, I will add more on this topic), Jessica Chastain is OK, so is the younger Murphy portrayed by Mackenzie Foy but the older Murphy portrayed by Ellen Burstyn is unconvincing. The supporting cast is, for the most part, forgettable, unidirectional and cartoonish (for instance the robots, the son Tom, the crew etc.). The script/plot is the main issue of the film, from the beginning we are introduced in a future society that has crop/food/drought problems due to climate changes and mildew. But these problems could not be planetary as we know that our planet does not have just a continent and the climate on those five continents differs dramatically, for instance Siberia has a totally different climate that Australia or India. Again if you have climate problems in middle of USA chances are, in the real life, that in northern Canada these problems will turn in advantages on your part, so why not re-settle in more advantageous regions on Earth instead of going directly into deep space with plan A (the whole planetary population towards another galaxy!!), this is the first and the biggest hole in the main plot. The second major issue of the script is the whole NASA business, it is secret, but somehow have huge funding for deep space programs, the government (a Orwellian one, no more or less) denies that space is a priority but secretly invest in it (why? we don't know and the script writers have no idea, too) and finally in the whole world only NASA/USA have deep space programs, the others no, they do not bother with space and the film makers are not bothered with them, too. Finally, the whole gravity/physics/equation/wormhole/black hole thing is again a very big plot hole. Firstly the professor get to the conclusion that Plan A (the whole population in space thing) can't be done (duh!) and secretly arrange Plan B(embryos in Cryostasis) without the knowledge of the space crew. All the pseudo-scientific theories regarding the fabric of time, gravity,black holes etc. are improbable and unbelievable, I know, it is an SF,but this part of this plot is too much especially the ghost part and entering of the black hole thing, with the fabric of time manipulated and equation solved by Coop and Murph in a very bad written scene. On top of this plot holes add a whole lot of bad Hollywood clichés and bad casting choices (for instance professor Brand, a 80 year old Cockney has a 30 year American Jewish daughter, young Tom is a Midwestern boy that turn into an East Coast fellow in his 40s, old Murphy is English, the young and midlife are not etc.) The movie has good potential, some parts are good, with beautiful scenes, but is again a case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as in many big Hollywood movies lately. The idea and script had potential, the cast had too. The CGI effects are OK, do not expect a heavy fight flick with shoot the alien between the eyes at every 30 seconds, as in Edge of Tomorrow for instance, a truly bad, over the top SF, no, it is a more thinking man SF but ultimately it fails due to the bad plot/scenario.

","Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic, inspired by the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched this movie for the first time a while ago, so not every detail is fresh in my mind, but it is very memorable and I have something to say. I think that everybody should watch Interstellar. It is one of those movies that everybody deserves to see in their lifetime. The premise of the movie is that Earth is dying, ""the Blight"" has basically destroyed almost all remaining food sources, with corn really being the last big plant. The movie focuses on Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, an ex-pilot for NASA who is now stuck farming (something he does not enjoy), and his relationship with his daughter Murph. The acting by everyone in this movie is phenomenal, and every relationship is painstakingly crafted. We get a good chunk of time on Earth to set up everything that will happen later in the movie. Eventually, we go into space, where we get some of the most realistic theoretical physics in any sci-fi movie. Everything in space looks amazing, actually the whole movie does. Christopher Nolan used no green screens when making this movie, and it shows, because all the sets are fantastic. The cinematography, tone, directing, and color palette are all perfect here. Everything about the look and feel of this movie is done perfectly. As for the story and screenplay, those are also done wonderfully. Even though this movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes long, it holds your attention for each and every second.

The drama works very well with the superb score of Hans Zimmer who got a lot of inspiration from the Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack and some from Event Horizon.

23 November 2014,charleswilliams98,1," A 3 hour Science Lecture delivered by a Village Idiot
","Let me start by saying that I have enjoyed Christopher Nolan's work in the past; Memento, Insomnia, (parts of) The Batman Trilogy. I find him a very talented film-maker with strong ideas and visual sense. Therefore it makes me very sad to state that, categorically, this is an absolute turkey. In many places, the plot is so full of holes, that you can do little but laugh-out loud. There will be reviewers on here, talking about DEPTH, Intimations of Mortality etc etc. Forget it. This is just a total misfire. Actors used to say, despairingly, that they were playing Johnny Exposition - you know the guy who explains everything to the audience. Note I said Despairingly. This has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the Mystery of Love (oh yeah). After a totally boring, drawn-out beginning which seems to be there to prove that Nolan has watched The Grapes of Wrath many times over, we get the first huge laugh when we meet Sir Michael Caine, with a laughable Posh - Cockney - American accent. He is playing the part that Sam Shephard (in this) or Morgan Freeman (usually) play. He is not up to it; never was never will be. It takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook and make it sound real. Caine's performance - like so many of his performances - screams out ""Where's my bleedin' paycheck?"" When Coop (Gary Cooper - westerns - get it) agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space, he blasts off like a Cosmic Cowboy, all bravado and charisma - at which point his fellow crew member shows him - with a pen and paper - what a wormhole is. Yes, when he is leading a flight into outer space, a little late doncha think? It gets worse, when poor Anne Hathaway, playing, as my son said - Science Girl, has to recite a monologue about Love and how it can cross all dimensions of space, time, blah blah blah. I really felt for her. I won't expand on the Plot, I couldn't if I wanted to. And the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved. This is NOT one of those films that you see and forget immediately, you will wake up in a few months time, laughing at Michael Caine's last scene or his recital of Dylan Thomas' famous lines - not once but twice...and the End. Oh the end. McConaghey gives it his all, having to cry on more than one occasion - believe me, I know how he felt. Don't believe anyone if they tell you 'you didn't GET it'. That's like saying you didn't GET an episode of Two and a Half Men. Ambitious yes, but a turd is a turd - even if they meant to produce a new hybrid Rose.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The black hole and the few glimpse of it are amazing and the movie is overall an interesting exercise of thoughts ( lot of room for interpretations ""wink"" ;) O.o ) ... it also has a fairly entertaining subplot led by m'a boY ""with many identities"" which gave a little more life to the show ---- but honestly it lacks on the visual experience ... not the quality of it , but it doesn't give you much to play with - very few is seen, in fact most of it is a cockpit or a corn field house... most of all some parts are TOO LONG on needless dialogues/self serving explanations ( going in a circles with some subjects...) which drags a good part of the movie to a point where even A. Hathaway couldn't finish her overly corny monologue without failing... this monologue could have been excellent , if it was maybe 2minutes shorter...the plot overall is fairly predictable since it plays with the same old school sci fi theme ( note that it leaves room to interpretation but still *** ) ... and also M.Mco is like mumbling the whole movie , which doesn't help with dominant ""bass""on the soundtrack ... lastly, yes it tries to reach the emotional side ( a subject i like : families) but it does not quite achieve it , mostly because of inconsistency in the writing which makes for some epic moments but also in many instances for some awkward/irrelevant/forced moments--- Anyway : still Worth a Watch and a Good movie.. i think most of the pb lies in the fact that it tries too hard and yet fall short doing so... i don't think this show is for everyone but i would give it a 7.5/10 ( please understand that even if i'm being critical .. this is objectively ... it doesn't mean that subjectively i didn't enjoy the show .... also : give me one of those robots :) ) --",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

I highly recommend watching this on a home theatre projector with surround sound and sub-woofer. It looks phenomenal on a big screen. Without a doubt, this movie is a solid 10/10.

The motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute, and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision. The special effects are unimaginative; Kubrick did it all better, without CGI, 50 years ago. The bombastic music's only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue.

I have to admit that I was expecting better - I purposely didn't read the IMDb customer reviews beforehand as I didn't want any spoilers or preconceptions. I really wanted to like this movie more, but sadly I didn't. There were so many parts of the story that were hard to follow and understand at times. Obviously from the ratings I'm in the minority.

However with the lovely scenery and the brilliant score your friend had made for the home movie you forget that it's just a glacier.

On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew.

","The opening of the movie was slow, allowing us to relate to the characters well, but the opening of the plot was too rushed. One second we headed towards the hidden nasa base and moments later we take off into space with hardly any clue of what's happening. What ensues is some pointless footage of space drifting with some mumbo- jumbo thrown in now and then with a lot of emotional drama. The matt damon part was utterly ridiculous and it was painful to watch him trying to pull off a psychopath. At some points the movie was so slow, i was forced to look at my watch. All I have to say about the ending was that, the movie must've been in production for too long and ran out of budget and they'd to complete it in 7 days. Conceptually it is ridiculous, (except maybe the earth part), gravity isn't a supernatural element outside space-time, it is a property of space(matter). The rest of the stuff is too geeky to go into. Direction was average and some of the sections were really annoying like who cares if the corn is torched, i just wanna see the grand adventure and don't spoil it by mixing unrelated events. CGI felt bland even in a 70mm Imax. I mean, dude! this is the space we're talking about, there is no limits to imagination, show us some breathtaking panoramas, some dazzling phenomenons of god's playground. Instead we get some helmets bobbing around in a zero- gravity chamber doling out wisdom to each other. Overall verdict : A space Odyssey is a subject that mankind has dreamed, imagined and pursued for generations and there is a rich plethora of source material to pick up from (if you suck at being original) like Jules Verne, Arthur C Clarke, Carl Sagan. With such a subject, when you throw in a name like Christopher Nolan, the bars are raised really really high.

OK, I was a bit far out there, but again it's a Nolan film so there are plenty of ""come again?"" moments even if your intelligence if plenty above ground. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a widowed father of two, who resides in a future where the crop is dying, and the world is in danger of extinction. Cooper, a pilot and a farmer himself, gets fatefully transported to a secret organization who at that time many thought no longer existed; we call them today NASA. Cooper is asked to go on a mission with space astronaut comrades to find another planet that can inhibit life so the people on earth don't have to face their impending doom on the endangered planet earth. Cooper has a wily 10 year-old daughter named Murph and a devoted teenage son named Tom. Murph is the one that is fully against her dad going on this longtime mission, an age part of the mission is that Coop stays the same age while the earthlings get older; beats Oil of Olay any day I guess! The mission is filled with complexities, deceit, discoveries, and challenges; and they even go and Save Private Ryan; OK, I am stopping there. Will Cooper ever see Murph and Tom again? Well, I am not not going to be an interspoiler by revealing that. Nolan proved once again that he is a master auteur with his direction of ""Interstellar""; but what I was enamored more about his orchestration of the film that he made the picture more as a love & bond story between a father and a daughter through the test of time (and this is big time) and their brawny magnetic force. The technical features of the movie were exemplary including its cinematography, production design, sound, and of course its extra special visual effects. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay was sure complex but very heartwarming, And yes, there was a a bit of a drag in the film's second act, but it all rightfully led to an astonishing third act. McConaughey continues his alright, alright, alright acting with his superb performance as Cooper. Anne Hathaway was outstanding as the fellow physicist astronaut Dr. Amelia Brand; and there was another brand that rated high, and that was the performance of Michael Caine as Amelia's father, Professor Brand who orchestrated the mission. The enchanting Jessica Chastain yet delivered another potent performance as the adult Murph. Other fine supporting work was lifted off by Wes Bentley as fellow astronaut Doyle, David Gyasi as the Black Hole expert Romilly, and child actress MacKenzie Joy as a young Murph.

","Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast.

Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded.

","Interstellar fell short of a 10 because the voices in some parts were too low, I simply could not hear what they were saying. In fact, we missed at least half of Professor Brand's (Caine) dying confession. Fortunately Murph (a brilliant Chastain) filled in most of those blanks. My other issue was with the scenes around the black hole and Cooper (McConaughey) awakening at the hospital. Those scenes were unnecessarily complicated and it was compounded by more muffled dialogue. Most of the movie addressed the science - factual and fictional - in a more understandable way and spread the harder concepts out. I loved everything else. All the actors stepped up. Standing with Jessica Chastain and Michael Caine were Matthew McConaughey, Ann Hathaway, John Lithgow, Matt Damon and Mackenzie Foy as young Murph. Matthew McConaughey is no longer just a hot guy doing his thing, he is a dad struggling to give his children a life and a future. He doesn't always make the right decisions but he's doing the best he can. Fortunately he has his weathered father-in-law (Lithgow) to raise his children while he goes off to save the world. Foy masterfully captures the emotions of the young daughter who so completely loves her dad and feels utterly betrayed by his decision to leave. Early on Brand (Hathaway) breaks down and I resented the 'hysterically emotional woman' implications of that. When I stepped back, though, I realized that unlike Cooper her whole life has been about the success of this one mission. She abruptly learns that a lifetime of planning and a lifetime of personal sacrifices does not guarantee success. Dr Mann (Damon) faces similar realities but allows it to blacken his heart.

","Originally a Spielberg project dating all the way back to 2006, it once again tries to answer several age-old questions such as: should mankind continue, why we are here, and what will we evolve into? Set in the not-so-distant future, but in a curious manner. Not written by Arthur C. Clarke. NASA is a secretive organization and yet cars and trucks look similar to today. After we learn all there is to know about Cooper's life and past, we finally ""blast-off"" after 43 minutes. Cooper is a former NASA pilot and it drawn back into the program by Prof. Brand and his daughter. Cooper leaves behind his family including his children Tom and ""Murph"". His son remains a farmer and she becomes a scientific genius. As the Earth is now a giant ""dust-bowl"" where nothing will grow due to a lack of rain and blight-failing crops. So we journey beyond our universe using a worm-hole provided by what appear to be friendly aliens but turn out to be evolved versions of Mankind. Beautiful images of wonder, space travel, hostile planets. Two astronauts die and a spacecraft is lost. There are robotic lifeforms (like ""HAL"") that can ""walk"" and remind us of the ""monoliths"" from Space Odyssey. Rather than even try to explain it all clearly, Cooper is somehow able to transcend the boundaries of the time-space continuum and communicate with his daughter, Murph, back on Earth. He gives her the gravity equations that allow NASA to move Mankind to another home world past Jupiter. Only Cooper and Brand's daughter return from Space. They are still young while everyone else has aged over 100 years. After saying goodbye to Murph, as she dies of extreme old age, he borrows a transport to rejoin ""Astronaut Brand"" as she attempts to establish a new colony. A good cast including John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Mathew McConaghey, Anne Hathaway, and newcomer Mackenzie Foy as ""Murph"". It's not a ""10"" in my book because the conclusion(s) are very hard-to-follow.

","The director Christopher Nolan needs no introduction. With expectations always high for every movie of his, every movie has lived up to it and Interstellar is no different. Enough is already known about the plot of the movie. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a former NASA pilot turned farmer who lives with his two children and father in a world which is facing increasing trouble in the form of a condition called blight which threatens to wipe out the Earth's food supply. Cooper takes the task of finding a new planet for human beings to migrate before it is too late. The movie is all about the adventurous expedition while also depicting the emotional turmoil that each of the expedition member goes through. The visual effects are stunning and dialogues are excellent as always. This is the simplest way in which such a complex subject can be rendered and Nolan makes sure that the audience doesn't get bored for a second dealing with a subject not so widely known. All the actors have done an excellent job but Matthew McConaughey steals the show. Background score from Hans Zimmer is amazing and adds life to the movie. The only drawback of the movie is the set of assumptions that Nolan is forced to take when dealing with such a subject. The audience may have no clue on what the characters are talking about.

1 December 2014,harsh-kabeer,7," Not a fanboy.
","High on ideas, low on emotions. That is Nolan's recipe. Sometimes, when I think of Nolan movie, it seems that Nolan is more interested in discussing his ideas than the story. For him, the ideas take the priority over plot. But still you need to go out and watch Nolan. Because it will be original and the like of which you haven't seen in years. It will be epic in its scope and substance and Nolan's failings are largely compensated by his visual flair and his huge ideas. He is there redefining blockbuster as we speak. Interstellar is the one film where I am okay with Nolan's inadequacy at handling characters and emotions. Not that it triumphs, but it does that in that sort of maudlin way that is acceptable enough for me as long as Nolan attacks us with his ideas. Also it helped that the supporting cast was brilliant. So no matter how bad and stupid they were, at least one could see a conviction in their one dimensional-ness. But still the movie suffers from some awkward emotional moments and some unbelievable coincidences that may appear to be out of place in a science fiction film. And Nolan being Nolan, he had even tried to explain those coincidences! Now coming to the great part. First thing that impressed me a lot was the idea behind annihilation of Earth. It was subtle, befitting and simple. I never for once got bored in the entire three hours. There were few grimaces here and there and a leap of imagination and acceptability to Nolan's logic, but it all turned out fine for me. Visually it is astonishing as could be expected from a visually proficient director. And few of the sequences really got you to the edge of the seat. There are lots and lots of expositions as Nolan walk you through his high ideas and make you familiar with black hole and relativity. But that is not a matter of complaint. It all fits except for when few ideas seem to be forced, especially the one about love. Though Nolan fits that in the movie, that moment was bit out of blue and emotionally dull. The music was good. The movie has a brilliant cast and much rest on Matthew and the cast helps a lot. Because it carries the audience through the rough patches. The best part is the immersion it offers. It really makes you think what if? And takes you on a ride where the consequences matter to you. What is at stake in the movie could be at stake for us in the future. And the movie makes you believe it and that is phenomenal. All in all, it is a pure Nolan film. Savour it on the largest screen. A blockbuster that makes you think- how rare is that! But if you are the one for emotional catharsis, then better avoid it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2014,Cameron-Smith1996,7," Amazing acting and special effects, confusing, overdrawn and uninteresting story
","To start with I think Christopher Nolan is a very good director who has made remarkable films. And he also tries (in my opinion) to to push himself further with each film. And it was clear from the get go that Nolan is yet again trying to push himself further, this time further than ever before. Unfortunately he has pushed himself a bit too far this time. Let me start of with the good of this movie. Matthew McConahey with out a doubt is the strongest part of this film, with one of the strongest performances I have ever seen from him, and the chemistry between his character and his characters daughter is very strong. The other actors such as Michael Cain, Anne Hathaway and various others also do a very good job and each character feel real, relatable and most importantly interesting. Even the two robot characters (yes there are robots) feel very human. And for someone who hates cgi Nolan sure knows how to use it to maximum effect. The landscape of the alien worlds are breath taking as is the scenes that take place in space. Now here is the bad of the film, it is too long with the content feeling very stretched. The story essentially revolves around three things, the main character and his family, the consequences of living in deep space and the effects of the relativity of time and the solution to save human race. And whilst this sounds on paper like there is enough to fill the whole 3 hours, in reality only the family aspect is explored with any real effect and whilst the consequences of living in deep space and the relativity time prove some truly emotional moments it doesn't feel like the fully explored there potential and then got trapped in the plot holes that come when you deal with time. And the solution to save humanity isn't touched on and without spoiling too much the way in which it was resolved was profoundly stupid. There was simply not enough to make the whole 3 hours feel fulfilled. And like I said it sadly turned very confusing and silly towards the end and left me feeling very bemused. In conclusion it had the makings of a great sci-fi but fell short on one too many things for that to be the case.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

10 November 2014,pavi-singh,9," Interstellar - A Interspace Endeavor that Stanley Kubrick would have Enjoyed
","INTERstellar – is not easy, not easy at all on your senses. It requires helluva effort to keep attention to the details, clutter-free your mind from all the dodgingly & myriad theories we have been fed on while absorbing the movie sequentially, peacefully yet trying to keep mental pace directed. Most joyful things about the movie, before I start: InterSTELLAR marks a yet again a great reunion of the Nolan brothers. Great to see Michael Caine and listen to Hans Zimmer's mesmerizing sounds uncertainising every scene. Anne Hathaway has a new look while Matthew McConaughey is simply perfect essaying the role of main protagonist. AND notice this – bridging the past to the present in the movie (subtly), very prominently it shows a Solar Powered Drone belonging to the Indian AIR FORCE (that has been hovering wildly for 10 years). From the first scene itself, your mind starts playing a intricate musical connecting you to one too many cinematic events chronologically. You get reminded of M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS – those vast agri-landscapes. As you nip a bit –the sensuality of SIXTH SENSE can't be missed. Moving on, its CONTACT for Armageddon's mission onto the a very intricately complex domain that tries to touch a chord deep within – starting with GRAVITY, it glimpses at THE BLACK HOLE; takes a closer clue from 2010: THE YEAR WE MADE CONTACT and then steering towards EVENT HORIZON, veers into melancholy of OBLIVION – PROMETHEUS - MOON; yet again to ride back into ELYSIUM. You watch the movie and you would notice your mind driving at a breakneck speed of thought processing – trillions of permutations and combinations to pave a straight simple path::: its not easy, we know:::::::: its not easy that, the NOLAN brothers knew. Last year GRAVITY re-marked the expected standards and interSTELLAR stands by that, it also endeavors hard to touch the masterly 2010: THE YEAR WE MADE CONTACT. While INTERstellar is a labour of Nolan's love for the relativity laden timespace, I felt it tried to come closer, even touch but just couldn't tip CONTACT. But here once again STANLEY KUBRICK remains the king with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, the master of it all. INTERstellar would remain with me for some months as I would enjoy watching/ noticing certain tidbits again and again (like I had to do with Inception) while I would exalt Christopher to attempt another endeavor into cinematic prime. Before we embark on interstellar, it shall be a good idea to re-watch 2001: A Space Odyssey, glance through Stephen Hawkins 'A Brief History of Time' while googling Kip Thorne. I remember reading an article in 1988 about the proposed space bull-dozers that should have been put to work to gather space debris and construct(if that is the right word) by 2020 a interspace travel gateway – the black hole somewhere near Jupiter and Saturn. If you happen to notice, by some calculations, all such theorists have earmarked rendezvous somewhere near Jupiter – Saturn juncture to make this possible. Look at all the movies and you would get the clue. Space probes have been in hot pursuit for that in the last few decades now. NASA's Juno would be at Jupiter in 2016 while ISRO joins as a helping hand to make manned landing possible on Asteroid by 2025 and on Mars by 2030. And that's what gives me the jitters, I am not sure; if Nolan (with his deep insight) is nudging us/ forewarning us of the apocalypse. Leaving Earth may not be far away – and that's leaves me onto the movie MELANCHOLIA.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

12 November 2014,khanbaliq2,8," Interstellar is driven by scientific concepts that fascinate and thrill in equal measure.
","Interstellar is a film about space travel and the heroism of reaching for something greater. The optimistic and forward-looking themes of this film are something that we haven't seen in American science-fiction movies for a long time. Because of this, Interstellar is definitely closest to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and The Right Stuff (1983). And like those two masterworks of film-making it's mostly about human nature and going into the unknown. Director Christopher Nolan and his screenwriter brother Jonathan have always tried to bring intelligence to their screenplays. One can find faults with the execution of the ideas in this film but it remains thought-provoking regardless. There isn't much action in Interstellar. Most of the time is spent on showing a nearly inhospitable future world and the mission to explore new worlds. Still, since this is a Nolan film, the action that's included is thrilling and no less awe-inspiring than in his previous films. In fact, the action alone is worth the price of admission. It's that good. I can fault Nolan for spending too much time on Earth because in Interstellar this setting just isn't that interesting. The messages of Environmentalism are also easy to notice. Sure, the time is spent on getting to know Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) family and why he decides to leave. But because this is a science-fiction movie it would have been better to spend more time on what happens in space. Interstellar is a slice of escapism with surprisingly good performances from the actors. Fascinating and thrilling scenes in the film are especially aided by Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy, Wes Bentley and Matt Damon. McConaughey effectively brings Cooper's internal conflict to the surface. He turns the widowed astronaut into a likable protagonist. I'll end my review by mentioning that Interstellar feels like an epic film. When it's over there's a feeling that a lot has happened. This visually dazzling experience takes unexpected turns. I can easily say that it's Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight (2008). Some people may disagree with me on this. I like Inception (2010) too, and I like The Dark Knight Rises (2012) in particular. Interstellar, however, is Nolan's most ambitious film. It's good enough to stand among the most ambitious science-fiction films ever produced. I recommend it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

You could discuss this movie in terms of its irrationality, its flawed physics, its attempts at explaining time travel and worm-holes (in a movie packed with plot-holes), its pseudo-scientific explanation of the 'existence' of love in humans, its overuse of the already overused 'Don't go gently into that good night' a poem both politically suspect and over-familiar to the point of banality.

The fact it's a whole load of old twaddle told in a way that's an insult to the intelligence. But what really pisses me off is its stance on our environment. Early on Matthew McConaughey, our hero, the protagonist whom we follow throughout the movie, says: Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here. His intellectual mentor, Michael Caine, says: We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it.

I could have done without the last 1/3, but the first 2/3 left me intrigued and breathless...just like he likes it. At one point a character demonstrates the time space dimension with a folded piece of paper; Nolan's films are just that: pages of a story folded over and over. You will love the characters, the pathos and the journey even when the point feels a bit - well - pointless. Plus, hard to fault a Science Fiction film for going all religious/philosophical. It's happened before and will happen again.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting in the movie was amazing from all the actors, especially from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, Usually the acting of children is very bad, but Mackenzie Foy gave an amazing performance, which is the best in my opinion in the movie, and she should have been nominated for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the space scenes in the movie were very amazing, especially the black hole, I recommend watching the movie and my rating for the film is 8.5/10.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","In my opinion,Interstellar is one of the best movies of Christoffer Nolan so far. Interstellar is a sci-fi genre movie in which the character played by Mathew McConaughey named Cooper lives a very normal life and where the earth's food resources are dying out and weather is becoming very nasty, so he goes out to space with the help of NASA to find a new habitat for the next generation of humans. To do that,he also had to say goodbye to the family for there better future, so he bids goodbye to his beloved daughter Murph and his son which is bittersweet. He goes out to space with a team and a robot named TARS which I found hilarious.From there the journey starts and it tells a story about how Cooper finds out that a new planet will not solve the problem of their habitat but a new dimension would and lost some of his friend on that journey.

","Interstellar get's a lot of praise, but the demographic seems to be split. People either like or dislike it. Personally I like it, but not as other people who like it did. I don't know I just felt as though most of the characters weren't interesting enough and just seemed to be pawns for exposition. The plot is complicated in that Nolan way, but here it is. In the near future, Earth is starting to suffer due to a giant dust bowl. Dr. John Brand (Michael Caine) enlists ex-pilot Joe Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to pilot a mission to find another planet. Unfortunately due to relativity of time, this causes Cooper to be away from his daughter Murphy Cooper (Jessica Chastain) for the majority of her life, even though the mission itself doesn't take that long. The story is very complicated and it can lose you if you're not paying attention, so if you liked Inception, you'll probably find this pretty interesting. The acting is good, but most of the characters, with the exception of Cooper and Murphy aren't very interesting. Actually half the time my favorite characters really end up being the robots which ironically seem more like people, than the actual people. However there is one thing this movie can not be denied. It's epic. It's shown on such a large scale that you have to get invested in what's going on, even if you don't understand it. Not to mention that soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is amazing. I'm actually listening to it as I'm writing this. If you like Nolan you'll probably like Interstellar.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","If you know or can get a hold of theoretical physics, you'll love this movie.
I just think of some of the most thought provoking, entertaining, well written movies, and I wonder at what point did half of these necessitate depression?
Personally I thought the Matt Damon sequence in the context of the film was a form of ""Dark Comedy"".....Just from when they woke him up you knew he was clearly out of touch with reality....then the statistical probability of docking while rotating like a toddler with hyperactivity. Then flying through a black hole just in a space suit....anything that hit the emotional buttons was negated.
I did feel it was a bit stretched out.....and I would have preferred some expediency to get an idea of Our protagonist reconnects with Cat Woman like Adam and Eve of a new world...but that cliffhanger like Inception seems to be a staple.
Overall entertaining, and far better than ""The Martian"" and ""Ad Astra""....I'm just saying for depression and feeling hopeless about the self destructive behaviors of humankind, I can read the paper every day, I enjoy the thought provoking film....but if it's going to be 2:47 minutes don't depress me in the ""artistic"" process.
Being a science fiction person and having some familiarity with theoretical physics I appreciate the movie. If I saw it in an IMAX I may have boosted it up a star.
All that being said there were too many scenes where I said to myself....e.g. can we save Coop, and blow up Dr. Mann more expeditiously please? Can they just say where going to Mann not your ex boyfriend without a metaphysical philosophical discussion on love (which could equally apply to true hate)?
With the suspension of belief, the on and off good and bad writing, and amazing effects I'll give it a seven.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","The thing that makes me always come back to Nolan films despite their awfulness is the mystery of how someone can be so obsessed with so many things that interest me and come up with an experience that speaks so little to what makes them worthwhile. Interstellar despite its unevenness, length, stops and starts (it plays more like a collection of stock classic sci fi scenarios than a coherent narrative) and some truly laughable parts is one of his more credible films (I'd argue it is there with Memento and The Dark Knight). Nolan's dorkiness is put to good use and the film's best parts do suggest old school hard sci fi novels it is trying so hard to emulate, the visual palate is a bit more vivid and before collapsing under his usual overexplanation some of its scenarios are more intriguing than dour. What escapes Nolan is that what makes something like Randezvous with Rama resonate is not those length scientific explanations and interchangeable overcompetent space professionals but that there is the unknown and the excitement of meeting it for the first time. Interstellar pays lip service to science explorer spirit but like all Nolan films it has no curiosity or imagination, it moves not toward an expansion of the gaze but its entrapment (as every other Nolan film men ultimately is in a trap of his own making even if a more benign one). Nolan's cinema is never about the possibilities of the unknown but about striping it of them.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","In Interstellar Christopher Nolan creates a breathtaking 70mm (the only way to see this movie) space epic. Starting Matthew McConaughey still riding high on the wave of the McConasaunce, as Cooper. McConaughey shows an even stronger emotional performance than the one that won him an Oscar in Dallas Buyers Club (2013). Just less of a physical transformation. Cooper is a father torn between his family and an opportunity to save the human race from destruction. This film is packed with A-list, top of their game actors who add icing to the cake on what is by itself a visually breathtaking movie. Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon, Michael Cane, John Lithgow and Casey Affleck to name a few. If you are a fan of Science Fiction this film is a must rush out an see, what are you waiting for, catch the next showing, movie. If you are not a fan of science fiction you might want to save this one for a rental. At 2 hours and 49 minutes, this film is a journey and investment that pays off greatly in the end. If you enjoyed last years Gravity (2013), you will like this just as much if not more. I am a huge fan of the late great director Stanley Kubrick. I have no doubt Christopher Nolan and his brother co-writter Jonathan Nolan belong to that same fan club. Interstellar is a contemporary 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). There are moments in Interstellar I longed to hear the beautifully orchestrated 2001 soundtrack to create that same emotion. So much to where after the movie I went home and immediately re-watched 2001. There is a comment made in Interstellar that the Apollo 11 space mission was faked, as an attempt to bankrupt the Soviet Union. Watch the documentary Room 237 (2012) and see what some people (myself included) think about Kubrick's role in the global ruse. 2001 was truly a film before its time. So why not have a new 2001; the year has come and gone. Interstellar is set in the future obviously, yet no actual date is ever mentioned. I assume so as not to date the material. The message in this space odyssey is much warmer than Kubrick's. Technology is no longer to be feared as in 2001. It is a companion, TARS the robot voiced by Bill Irwin is the exact opposite of HAL 9000; Helpful, funny, insightful and user friendly. Yet in appearance TARS is a cross between the 2001 monolith and a Transformer. The pressing need for environmental change and mankind's fear of extinction is the overall message. Its solution is much like that of the Beatles, all you need is love. Overall, not looking in too deep into all the plot points, and not getting too lost in the science of relativity and quantum physics; Interstellar delivers the best Science Fiction film this year.

They don't all ring true in the end as the Nolans have add fourth dimensions and love as a throwback to the silliness of other more formulated and accessible movie formats. The interesting thing here is that the Matt Damon character is such a coward, ""don't judge me"" while looking up at the ""stars"" of his grandiose existence. he represents scientists and much as anyone else in the film. It's heartbreaking as well, but that keeps us going. The pacing is the hidden gem of the film.

","High rated movie, expected with big hype in it's time, as it was (and is) usual with Christopher Nolan movies.
Indeed, it is visual masterpiece, with stellar casting, but I did not see much from title - Interstellar travel was marginalized, actually all it was some half minute wormhole crawling. Scientific part was marginal too, but that was to expect. Instead it, we has some high emotional family drama, combined with heavy 'time dilatation', fifth dimension again, combined with gravity. All it with some goal, but will not go into it to not spoil it.
Sad thing is that all it did not make much sense. There were spectacular shots, landscapes, but our heroes, at least scientist ones made mostly bad decisions. Exception was main character Cooper, just a pilot/engineer. Well, that's what people likes to see, I guess.

Nolan, after not giving many f***s to emotions in his entire career, goes so mushy in space that he creates another dimension for love. Had it not been the young Murph & the brilliant McConaughey who is becoming the Daniel Day Lewis of this decade, Interstellar could have been an spectacular melodramatic trash. While Matt Damon gets the worst role of his life, thankfully in another galaxy, Nolan takes his hero-saves- Anne Hathaway fetish to another level. The saving grace was the best of Nolan - the last perpetually spine-chilling 40 minutes with alluring visuals & Zimmers beautiful mind-f**k score. The plot is practically simpler, theoretically complex than the likes of Memento, Prestige, Inception, but there is a Planet Mann sequence that is worse than Dark Knight Rises climax!

","So who thought up the science-heavy dialog in this? Sure, for astronomy and science buffs, this would be a goldmine, but I seriously doubt anyone who is not familiar with the concepts would understand it at all. But it is an all-star cast, which goes to prove that you can have the greatest actors ever and still have a lousy script. Okay, so Earth is being destroyed and we have to move. I can gather that, and I can understand the wormhole idea. It's very familiar to me, but why park Humanity next to a black hole? And then we find out it's not a real black hole? Look, all I can say is that the movie is very long with a lot of dialog and no real connection to what is going on. I could think up a thousand better beginnings and several ways to make the script way more dynamic. Instead, as the astronauts travel through the wormhole to explore a possible new home, life goes on back on Earth as a daughter is faced with anger because her dad left them, A fraudulent equation is the one best hope for humanity, but there is an alternative to rebuild. And Matt Damon, aka Jason Bourne, is a pathetic character that is trying to get rescued a little too much. And, in another tie-in with 2001, Matthew McCoughany (sp) falls into a magical portal that helps humanity be saved. Only difference is that, in 2001, it was a black monolith. Here, it's a black hole.

6 April 2020,zeekwunlau,9," The biggest enemy is actually human
","Three hours is the limit of a movie's viewing time. Even if the plot is unsatisfactory, the audience nestled in the black box will be restless. ""Interstellar"" just less than 3 hours, is on the critical line to exercise patience of the audience. In the last half hour, utterly covering his heart with his hands in prayer, Matthew McConaughey went further into the sky, and took a step back to lose all. The moment when I got up from the theater seats and finally returned to the earth after getting out of the cabin, I was generally terrified. In the endless time and space, we feel thrilled and tormented, with the protagonist wandering between hope and despair, exhausted. I very much agree with what the author in ""The Odyssey of the Abyss"" said: ""The film contains a nesting metaphor for the film itself. From the ordinary life into the dark theater, and in the darkness through the screen to another life , And then in another life, suddenly embarked on a wonderful journey, layer by layer into the play and layer by layer, with the flow of people out of the theater, and not into the streets and turbulent In the vulgar. There are several layers of dreams, there are many galaxy. The high stars are not related to us, it seems that one day they will cover our daily life. ""Therefore, it can be said that"" Interstellar Crossing ""is a mass participation. In the movie, I ca n't understand the wormhole, why Matthew falls vertically from outer space and can fall into a ridiculous five-dimensional space, although there is no ability and knowledge to analyze this hard science fiction from a physical point of view, But it does not prevent us from sitting on the seats of the movie theater for a long time, and using our own way to explain and understand. I 'm glad that Nolan played the finale of a magic stick without disappointment: the ""them"" who inspired the exploration all the way is us, we are the ""them"", and there are infinitely fragmented pieces in her daughter Murphy 's bookshelf In time, the father who regretted going to explore the universe returned to the point where the wrong decision occurred again and again to hint to himself. It's similar to the heroine who died several times in ""Terror Cruise"" but couldn't get out of the game. In this way, five-dimensional space is just a concept, not difficult to understand. I'm not a fan of Nolan, but in my own opinion, ""Interstellar"" is undoubtedly the biggest and most ironic movie in all his works and penetrates the topic of human nature. In the November file last year, I also watched ""Gravity"" in Daguangming. If we simply look at the theme of ""survival,"" the Nolan Brothers script would like to discuss the complexity of human nature and the mutual guidance of humanity in the collective subconscious reincarnation. The role is much more complicated than that of Sandra Bullock 's survival and jumping game; George Clooney faces the non-human suave and up-and-coming calm image of death in the vast universe, self-assured man in Matt Damon Dr. Eun looked vulnerable. There is almost no comparability in the text, but in terms of visual technology, there are exactly 80% gravity and 130% gravity Miller planet and hill planet, so that the actors do not have to float to perform, and it also saves a lot of later expenses. Rather than being played with by nature and the mysterious universe, looking at the biggest enemy in Interstellar from the surface is time, and then looking at the inner core, the biggest enemy is man himself. The universe is worn around, so innocent.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
16 July 2018,jeremy3,7," A good movie with some flaws.
","The movie was very exciting and had a good cast. People on Earth could only grow corn now due to a blight. There were a lot less people and most lived in rural areas growing corn. Even the New York Yankees had relocated to the country. Matthew McConaughey plays a farmer who once was a top pilot. He and his daughter somehow figure out where a secret NASA base is located. When they investigate they are captured and one of the people there is an old professor of his played by Michael Caine. Caine believes that the World will end in two generations due to a projected corn blight. McConaughey is recruited to take a crew through a wormhole to a neighboring galaxy where there are three planets that may support life. An early mission, led by an astronaut played by Matt Damon, disappeared on one of the planets. When the crew arrives on the planet where the astronaut is located, it turns out that the astronaut had been playing a con game. He pretended that there was urgency to come to the planet to save humankind, but in reality he cowardly just wanted to be rescued from the isolation of being the only person on the planet. There is also the duplicity of NASA in believing that they could let all of humanity die while letting a few colonizers continue life on a new planet. 
 The movie was very good with a great story, but had a few flaws. Firstly, when the crew arrives on the first planet there is nothing but still water a few feet deep. However, suddenly miles away a giant tidal wave about one thousand feet high appears. It only takes a few moments to get to within a few hundred yards of the space ship. The tsunami in Indonesia a few years ago was only about twenty feet high, but traveling at 535 miles per hour. It would seem logical that a thousand foot high tsunami would be traveling faster and with even more deadly force. Yet, suddenly the tsunami slows down and gives the astronauts tons of time to get back into the space ship. Still, one astronaut is killed when the female astronaut, played by Anne Hatthaway, insists on retrieving important data left by the previous exhibition to the planet. One of the four astronauts is killed. And, the force of the tsunami that big would probably destroy and crush even the strongest built space craft. 
 Another major flaw was that the movie assumed that all of the audience understood what was going on. Not everyone understands all the science involved and the movie needed to do a better job explaining how the science was plausible. The only possible explanation for the spaceship surviving the massive tsunami is the word ""gravity of 130%"". The significance of 130% was not very well explained. 
 Another problem had to do with the DVD I was watching. Some DVDs are not very good with sound. Oftentimes, characters were practically whispering, particularly Matthew McConaghey's character. There was some important dialogue going on, but I could not hear a lot of it. 
 Lastly, the last part of the movie was very complicated. While I did understand the concept of Love and the connections between events in the movie, particularly with his daughter and how she reacted to his abandoning the family for the mission, it seemed fantastic. The robot and the female astronaut eject from the space station, but the main character does not. Not really explained. Also, at some point, he ejects from his space craft. Not really explained. Also, I was wondering how a space craft could travel through this enormous worm hole at fantastic speeds and not hit one of the countless objects in the worm hole. It would take an exact projection of where all possible objects could be located to avoid the space ship from being destroyed. 
 Fantastically, the main character is rescued by the NASA station. The NASA Station was able to be refitted and went into space, becoming a two-dimensional circular micro World where some of humanity had survived (there was an eighty year time lapse due to the astronauts going deep into space and time becoming relatively faster). 
 Overall, a very good movie. Some things needed to be explained better. The movie got a bit confusing towards the end.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christopher Nolan's latest film ""Interstellar"" plays off a number of themes and subjects. The movie is held in the near future. Earth is becoming environmentally unlivable, with Blight and Dust Storms scoring the land. Matthew McConaughey, plays ""Cooper"" a Widowed former NASA Pilot and Engineer, turned Farmer, who lives with his father-in law ""Donald"" (John Lithgow), Son Tom, and ten year-old daughter ""Murphy"", better know as ""Murph"", in what I feel is one of the best performances by a child actor in a movie I have seen, played by Mackenzie Foy, as she portrays deep emotion that is impressive for an actor of any age. Murph believes there is a ghost haunting her room, trying to communicate with her. Cooper discovers that the ""ghost"" is an unknown form of intelligence, sending them coded messages, by means of gravitational waves altering the dust on the floor, directing them to a secret NASA installation led by ""Professor Brand"", played by Michael Cane. Cooper is recruited by Brand for a Space Mission, believing that humanity's fight to survive is a losing battle and proposes that the solution is to colonize another galaxy. Cooper is joined by three astronauts, including Brand's Daughter ""Amelia"", played by Anne Hathaway. As mentioned, the movie plays off a number of themes and subjects. To Name Some - The Environment, Science, Space, Worm Holes, Other Dimensions, Passage of Time and Human Relationships – Parent to Child Love and Romantic Love.. The movie does have power moments, and is a visual treat at times, though there is one short visual sequence in the first 3rd of the movie that took part in Space, that didn't look that impressive to me. Caine, Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain, playing an older ""Murphy"" as the film progresses give very effective supporting performances. McConaughey, in his first major leading Film Role since his Oscar Winning Turn in ""Dallas Buyers Club"", performance gets more effective as the movie progresses. In the end, the Movie does make you think, and the powerful scenes are very emotionally moving. The science talk may go over one's head at times to a point.

There's nothing wrong with these films. There's no reason that I didn't see them immediately. But perhaps that they are all well over two hours.

Or are they attempting to come back to Earth and save the people by escaping the disaster environmental disaster that has become our beautiful planet? A wonderfully thoughtful and beautifully directed film with perfect special effects. Interstellar despite its three hour length is pretty much a must see. Again, like Ex Machina one of the few films of recent memory that I would actually rewatch and I believe thoroughly enjoy the details. And the sentiment, as well as the brilliant character played by Matt Damon. I'd heard that he didn't want to do too many space films becoming typecast as the space film guy with the Martian and Interstellar but with fantastic scripts like these, it may as well become the space film guy. He was also in Elysium, another kind of space film, but not nearly as good as Interstellar, a great film along with Ex Machina, that I believe will become a classic rewatched and thought about for years a modern 2001 A Space Odyssey. I hope you'll enjoy Interstellar.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","If this film isn't nominated for some awards at the Oscars, there's something wrong with the Academy. This is one of the best films of 2014, and it definitely deserves more than 73% fresh. That's too low of a score. I'd say it's more around the 90-95% range. It's an absolutely amazing film. Pardon the pun, but I'd even go so far as to say this movie is...wait for it...stellar. This is what ""Gravity"" should have been. It's a very thought provoking film and needs to be at least nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards. There are some issues with sound mixing where the sound muffles the dialogue sometimes, but according to Christopher Nolan, this was intentional. Don't wait for Blu-ray. See it while it's still in theaters! Your stomach will rumble when the ships take off, and you will be amazed at the visual effects. This film has plenty of heart, humor, and an intriguing plot that will make you forget it has a 3-hour runtime. It feels more like 2 hours.

IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO DIE HERE. Let's travel to a parallel world in the new film Star Trek I mean Interstellar. But seriously what's the damn difference,this movie is about space exploration for an inhabitable world and Star Trek is just still space exploration. The film is about a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage. I honestly could not tell you if this film achieved it's goal or not because I'm not sure if it's trying to be fun or just something else.

The film is way too long they could have finished it sooner but decide not too and it just makes that much harder to sit through. The story is not that interesting,with it's theme being about you know take care of the earth which we've seen to death in some better movies.

The performances from the film are solid even from actors who I don't find too be great but just OK(Topher Grace).

The direction from Christopher Nolan this time around is not all that great,he gets good performances out of his actors OK but he always does. The problem was the shots and worst of all I saw lens flares,is he turning into J.J Abrhams. The only worthwhile point from the movie is what I had just mentioned earlier,it's about taking care of our planet,but like I've said we have better films then this for that. The movie is also way too long,i did find a problem with it's pacing everything feels slow. I believe it's because Nolan wants us to take in everything were seeing on screen.

","I was very curious to see Christopher Nolan's latest movie Interstellar even though I'm not a sci-fi fan - but I'm a fan of Mr. Nolan-, plus both public and critiques made very positive comments about it. The story is set in a world devastated by drought and famine that will lead humanity to extinction unless a group of NASA scientists and explorers find another planet where life is possible. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is chosen to be the pilot of the Endurance that will leave for a journey through space. Cooper is put in front of a choice: staying with his children on Earth or following Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway) and her crew to possibly save the world. The movie is beautifully conducted by director Nolan. Cinematography and sound work perfectly together and give a sense of total immersion in this breathtaking travel. The alternation of moments of music composed by Hans Zimmer, sounds and complete silence accompany the events and the steps of the journey and, at the same time, contribute to create feelings of anxiety, astonishment and isolation. Isolation is always present in the movie: the explorers are alone in space, they are small compared to the immensity of the universe while people on Earth are condemned to death - they feel like they have been left alone. Cooper's house itself is isolated: we don't feel presence of others except for the main characters - humanity that needs to be saved is an entity whose pain and curse we don't perceive. The film is focused on individual stories: a father who decides to leave his children to follow the aspiration that was denied to him in the past, even though the goal is universal: saving human race. Time is the undeniable protagonist and villain: Cooper, Murphy and Amelia have to find a solution before it is too late. Shifting of time The cast does a wonderful job - especially Academy Award winner Matthew Mccauneghy, although of course it can't be compared to the performance that got him the Academy Award. Overall I liked this film even though I'm afraid that in the end, screenwriters Nolan pushed their creativity way too far and weren't able to find (in 169 minutes) a better solution that would more realistically lead the film to an happy end. It is so strained that makes the film lose all its atmosphere. The problem with this kind of movies - Gravity does the same mistake, in my opinion - is that it is hard to conciliate powerful visuals with a beautiful story. I admit that it does get emotional at times and it is not always predictable but It seems like the storyline is sacrificed into clichés in order for technical aspects to be at their best. Visual should support the story and not vice versa. It is a stunning movie, but yet not the best from Nolan, who is now considered a legend for his capability of creating other dimensions and for this reason it is easy to have too high expectations for his works that not always will be satisfied.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

If Albert Einstein couldn't explain his ""Theory of Relativity"" in plain English, then why would anyone expect the 20 million people who watch this to get it? Too long, too cutely ended, and too confusing. With way too many obvious flaws in physics to bother mentioning any. Liked the cinematography and the basic plot and always like Mathhew McConaughey. Anne Hatheway seemed to be lost in space and Jessica Chastain as interesting as ever. I don't regret watching this film, even enjoyed a lot of the special effects.

","Despite the fact that I adore Christopher Nolan I just wasn't a huge fan of the trailers as I don't really like realistic space movies but this and 2015s The Martian have turned me as I though this was a fantastic movie even if it doesn't quite live up against Nolans other movies. I will be honest though the first time I watched it I wasn't a huge fan but this is definitely a movie that gets better and better with repeat viewings. But Nolans fingerprints are all over this it has an incredibly intriguing plot that is fully explored that was one if my worries watching this movie that it wasn't going to realise it's full potential but it did and made Interstellar very intriguing and smart. This film is directed beautifully there's no need for constant cuts and movement sometimes you just need to let the actors act and that's exactly what Nolan did. The space sequences in this movie are incredibly the special effects are perfect to the point where it looks and feels real. I loved the way the other planets were designed not only is it incredible to look at but there feel like real places that could exist out there somewhere. Christopher Nolan always inspire fantastic performances from his actors (look no further than Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight) and Interstellar is no different as there is not a single bad performance in the movie but ultimately its Matthew McConaughey who steals the entire movie in an Oscar Worthy performance. The actress who play young Murph Mackenzie Foy is also fantastic here and stays on par with Jessica Chastian who plays Older Murph. Say whatever you like about Anne Hathaway but I really like her as an actress as she gives one of her best performances here. But unfortunately the great performances in the movie can not save Interstellar from its biggest issue, the characters. There's just so many of them and other than McConaughey you don't really care about any of them I couldn't even name the other members of the crew and characters like Michael Caine and Casey Affleck just don't seem important enough. Without spooling anything I will say that there was an incredible sequence in this movie that was spectacular to look at but ultimately merely felt like a means to advance the plot forward and came across as to easy. This is the longest of all the Christopher Nolan Movies and it shows because Interstellar is far to long I think they could have easily cut a good 30 minutes out it. Overall though I really to like Interstellar the performance, direction and set pieces are all fantastic even if it has some problems with its characterisation and script. 86%-A-",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Some lines are downright random and feel shoved in to create foreshadowing. The encounter with the UAV was odd. It seemed token. The characters tend to have trouble emoting and their acting seems uneven. Some scenes they seem real and gripping but others they feel wooden. That's all I can come up for criticisms.

As well as being impressive visually, it is also an emotional story exploring father-daughter relationships that really gets the audience invested in the characters and gets them to really feel what the characters themselves are going through at different stages of this film. Plot wise the film is very strong and compelling right from the very beginning to the final seconds, being a Christopher Nolan film. Now to the negatives because it is not a perfect film, i think one thing that it suffered from was asking a lot of the audience. There are times in this film where lots of information is being thrown at the audience and at times it is almost too much to try to understand what just happened and pay attention to what is happening now. Also I feel that the film was a little too long and around 20 minutes could have been cut out from the middle without losing a whole lot of information.

So many questions nolan always leaves audience with, but one thing is for sure it makes you watch his film again and again. Not just because of Story, Concept, screenplay, Score, Acting or story line. Every single dialogue is perfectly written which connects All three Acts together so unified that makes nolan different from others.
by watching interstellar you will forget if its a sci-fi, every aspect of film is so realistic until the tesseract sequence you would say its nothing reachable by humans but the truth is its NOT. 
Some hardcore Cosmos Science + Love Emotions + Technology Development only Nolan can put all of these elements in a film together so that even you do not understand some astronomy stuff but you will remain attach to the film.

I do not care if at some moments some scenes were not as convincing or as spectacular as they might have been, because I really was inside the movie all the time, a movie that gives back to science fiction cinema the glory it deserves.I even found some comments of critics-especially here in Greece-that were suggesting that the movie becomes melodramatic and weak as it unfolds, as untrue, although I would be the first to condemn such characteristics in a movie-and I was afraid Nolan would easily succumb to them.Instead, I felt deeply moved by the connection between the cosmic and the personal Nolan offers, in a screenplay that, at last, shines, not with cleverness, but with true wisdom, a perfect incorporation of astrophysics theory(that could again get easily ridiculous,if not properly handled) and even glimpses of humor.An epic that deserves its place in film history as an absolute winner!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Even when huge jumps are made in logic we can recognize something in them that rings true, and that happens in Interstellar as well, but it also contains some mind bogglingly stupid assumptions, which for me completely and utterly destroyed my ability to believe in it. Firstly, the blight - we are supposed to believe that 50 years from now an organism evolves on Earth which not only breathes atmospheric Nitrogen, but simultaneously destroys every crop we grow for food. This is a complete contradiction, any organism that fixes gaseous Nitrogen has to metabolize that Nitrogen into a fixed Nitrogen compound such as Ammonia or Nitrate, those things we actually use to grow our crops.

","I cannot remember the last time I've been this split about a movie, the way I am with 'Interstellar'. The movie features a general plot that I absolutely love, Earth is dying and Earth's remaining survivors must send people in search for a new planet to save mankind. I've always been fascinated by space and I love how Nolan explores the unknown, such as far off galaxies, wormholes, blackholes, and gravity. The brilliance is that he is basically free to do whatever he wants with them since hardly anything is known about such anomalies. Time was at the center of the movie, it was the driving force for the main character and it was intriguing to see how time manipulated people's motives, its a force you cannot fight and win against. But on the other end of the spectrum, with a movie like this, you open up a door to a plethora of questions, which happens to be the case. There are moments where the movie just forces you to assume something with very little explanation (especially characters motives for doing certain acts). The movie also beats you over the head with constant talk about gravity and relativity, as if the entire audience had a PhD in physics. That was a huge drawback for the film, it relied so heavily on those concepts that it was hard to follow or understand as they went from one idea to the next with little explanation. You know when you have a real life physicist on the set explaining such topics to you, that the audience might be left behind scratching their heads. As for the acting department, the movie was surprisingly tame, outside of Matthew Mcconaughey, no one stood out, they just did their jobs and that was the end of it. Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Caine were all fine, but certainly nothing to brag about. As for the ending, I still have mixed feelings about it, I really wanted a huge 'No way!' curveball thrown at me, but instead we got an overly explained ending that we knew would tie into the beginning of the film. But it was sort of bittersweet in a sense and I kind of enjoy that type of thing. But again, not enough can be said about the general ideas Nolan wanted to put on screen, they were ambitious and very intriguing to think about post film. I'm glad someone took a chance on such complicated and sought after ideas, even if they came up short (we surely will not be seeing something of this caliber in a very long time).

","Christopher Nolan is probably my favourite director of all time with FIVE 5-star films from him that I've seen. This was the last major Nolan film I had yet to see, and I absolutely loved it. The visuals in this film are just fantastic. Even if I watched this on mute I'd still get more out of it than most films. The score is just absolutely phenomenal too - people make fun of Hans Zimmer's scores a lot, but they really work at building tension in my opinion, and bar Inception this might be his best work. The direction is fantastic and the sheer scale of the film just blew me away. At risk of sounding cliche, this felt very 2001: A Space Odyssey, except with a legitimately engaging story (and I love 2001 so that's a huge compliment). The relationship between Cooper and Murph is well explored. The main issue that people have with Tenet is that The Protagonist doesn't have much of an emotional connection with anyone, meaning the personal stakes are kind of low. I didn't mind this myself, but this film just showed that Nolan can do personal stakes and do them really well. Part of this is Matthew McConaughey's outstanding performance, but mostly it's just how their relationship is set up during the opening and how well it is closed off. The ending just blew me away, and every direction that the story took really worked for me. My only nitpick is that some of the exposition felt a tad clunky towards the beginning, but exposition is important in a film this high-concept, so I can forgive that. And, for an almost 3 hour film, I didn't feel the length for a second. Overall, this is an inspiring, beautiful and an utterly fantastic film, and one of Nolan's best.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Cooper is your run of the mill ex pilot, engineer, and obviously single parent forced by the government no less to run a farm.

I hope I get to see the IMAX footage, once it comes to DVD and Blu Ray. So, with that said, I thought Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job on directing the movie as well as writing it with his brother Jonathan Nolan. The special effects in this movie are breathtaking with the use of its mixture of practical and CGI effects. Hans Zimmer's music is really wonderful, and there were parts of the music where it does make you think of the music in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The cinematography is so beautifully well shot, and I thought the cast did great. Matthew McConaughey does a great job as the main lead, while Anne Hathaway; Jessica Chastain; Mackenzie Foy and Michael Caine were all great in their own roles. The movie is also very well paced, and the movie does have that sort of realism where you can realize on what space is like besides another great movie about space, and that movie is of course ""Gravity."" I will admit that the ending was weak, but its by no means terrible or anything spectacular; it just is for what it is. ""Interstellar"" is definitely a work of art, and this is the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" of our time. I highly recommend this movie, and it is definitely a must see! I don't know what is my number one favorite movie of 2014, but I know that ""Interstellar"" is really on my best films of 2014 list. If you don't like this movie, I will respect that but I just couldn't help myself on how wonderful ""Interstellar"" really is, and really do wish if I ever see this movie in IMAX. I could be surprise if they reissue this movie back in to theaters and IMAX for another viewing. So, that is all I got to say about ""Interstellar"" and I give this movie a 10 out of 10. Really love this movie!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Most of the time when you play it smart and try to do the intelligent thing you'll still miscalculate something and make a mistake. As hard as it is it's always better in the end if you follow your heart, and chase the feeling of love. Decisions for survival is by any means necessary. You can lie or cheat for survival and do whatever you have to do.

That's like throwing a life raft to a drowning person....three miles from where they are located...and then expecting them to find it and swim to it. And if this race is so advanced they can create worm holes, and are so interested in helping us, why not come through it themselves and help us on our end? And then they go through the worm hole and find the closest, and what appears at first to be the most promising planet is orbiting a black hole? Really? Did anyone in this SCIENCE fiction movie even read a science book? Let's ignore how a planet that close to a black hole managed to retain water and an atmosphere after going through the super nova that created it. Let's assume it did. But a planet orbiting close enough to a black hole to experience the time dilation effects they are talking about would have three major problems. One, the black hole, any black hole, emits vast amounts of high energy radiation. Xrays for one. This generated by the synchrotron radiation of dust and gas being sucked into the hold. In other worlds, radiation levels would be unsurvivable, even for very brief times. Two, tidal forces on the planet would be phenomenal. The planet would be in a constant state of seismic upheaval. In fact, it's doubtful that it could even remain intact. Three, said tidal forces, amongst other things, would quickly degrade the planet's orbit, causing it to spiral in and get eaten by the black hole....as all things do that get too close to one.

","Every person that I have talked to after seeing Interstellar love this film. Christopher Nolan has gone above and beyond, more so with this film than any other film of his. He has literally transcended time and space Interstellar and his enormous amount of work and effort should be recognized. This story is one of the most touching and emotional stories I've ever seen, especially for the 2014 year. Christopher Nolan deserves to be nominated for Best Director and for Best Picture. He has been snubbed so many times before whether it was for The Dark Knight or Inception. Christopher Nolan has become one of the best auteurs, creators, innovators, and a try actor's director. Interstellar is a very complicated film full of scientific terms and data that go beyond the understanding of average moviegoers. With that, Nolan effectively communicates the main theme to the audience as well as the complicated concepts surrounding the theme. There was never a time where I didn't accept what I was watching. In many films I will always ask why this happened and why that happened but with Interstellar, Nolan made it clear and kept the viewer so engaged that you would leave the theater thinking about the film rather than during. During the film, the viewer actually feels like he/she is part of the experience. Promoting this film more, on top of receiving Oscar noms for Best Picture and Best Director, the film's star's Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain should all gain recognition for their performances. McConaughey has once again wowed us just like his performance last year in Dallas Buyers Club exposing a real rawness and depth in his performance. As for Hathaway and Chastain, they give outstanding supporting performances full of emotion and range. The next element deserving praise would be Hans Zimmer's outstanding score. The score kept the film flowing and added to the excitement. It's Zimmer's best score since Inception and before that, Gladiator. It is no surprise that I loved this movie and I think most audiences did as well. It's a beautiful film about love transcending time and space and the importance of family.

I will not say Interstellar is Nolan's best movie, because you can't compare movies that are on the same, incredibly high level, but this one just might be his most powerful work. I cannot recall the last time a movie moved me so well. While for a lot of the movie, the viewer is left guessing where the film is headed next, or how it will get to a climax, the last 45 minutes will have you on the edge of your seat to the point to where if you fall off you won't even notice because your eyes will never leave the screen. This movie was a complete joy. As nearly all of Nolan's works are, every aspect of this movie was of the highest quality. The actors were fantastic. the visuals put even Avatar to shame.

","Christopher Nolan has a reputation of psychologically deep, convoluted, and complex thrillers (ie., Inception, Memento, etc.), and Interstellar is no exception.Interstellar takes place in a dystopian future in which the human race has lost the majority of it's resources and must rely on farming for food.As the Earth is slowly dying and the human race is coming to an end, a group of people set out through a wormhole to find a new planet for humans to live on. To say anymore than that would be a spoiler and it is best to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. Interstellar is a movie that gradually changes in tone and style as it goes on. The first act is very intriguing and leaves you interested in finding out where the movie is going. It does a good job establishing the dystopia and what it is like for the people on earth. There is also an underlying theme of human drama mostly between a father and his children. The second act takes a drastic turn and becomes a sci-fi adventure with an abstract feel to it. There is suspense, thrills, great visuals and special effects, and an overall very good story that sucks you in. The third and final act of the movie takes an unexpected twist and is one of the most interesting and original things I have ever seen in a movie. Interstellar has a very strong cast; there are great performances from Matthew Mcconaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast as well. There is also a great use of music that helps to build the tension. Interstellar is not perfect; the main flaw being that it is slightly too long. I found the second act and part of the third act to drag on and become too drawn out. I also felt that there were too many story elements happening at once and it became overly bloated at times rather than sticking to the story I was interested in. In conclusion, although slightly too long and bloated, Interstellar is a great psychological thriller that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll.

I do not understand those people, to be honest, though everyone is entitled to their own opinions of course. This movie is perhaps different from a lot of other movies, yes, as it is not purely based on entertainment values (e.g shoot, kill and laugh). Instead, it requires a level of intellectual understanding. Maybe scifi to some, but who says there are no additional dimensions which we have not discovered yet? Reality check here: if you had told people some 100 years ago we had men walking on the moon and that air travel would be a very common thing these days, they would have thought we were crazy! So try to think beyond the current human knowledge, and you'll understand that there is yet SO much more for us to discover, to explore! Interstallar deals with this perfectly and gracefully in my opinion. And it is very correct in physical terms too (e.g. no sounds are audible in space - when the explosion occurs).

I don't know if it is because I have read some great scifi but this one wasn't particularly super wonderful. In reading wonderful sci fi, I get the benefit of a certain amount of description of the fabulous plot, world building, creatures, characters etc. My mind does the visualizations. And I prefer it that way. It is part of the enjoyment that is appealing about scifi: we have to use our imaginations. (This is similar for me with music videos: when they first came out I hated them as I had no interest in someone else's interpretation visually of the music - even if it was the writer of the music themselves. ) With the moviemakers they have to do that visualization for us. I liked the premise of this movie. It got stretched a little thin probably due to the limitations on the length of the movie itself. But the premise and the story weren't better and I mean as good as many books I have enjoyed. Did they do a fab job turning a story and premise like this into a movie.

","Grand scale, large score, big visual effects, typical Nolan movie? Um...not so much. This one is really difficult to summarize briefly, and may take multiple viewings to do so. I didn't quite know what to expect based on the previews and I tried not to find too much out about it ahead of time, which ended up to be the right move as many things about this film were surprising. A character drama on HUGE scale and a HUGE screen. IMAX is the place to catch this film in its glory as over an hour of the film was actually filmed with 70 mm IMAX cameras. And those scenes are breathtaking. At a run time of 169 minutes, you get your money's worth of screen time here, and at times it feels like it. This is not ""Inception"" or a ""Batman"" movie. ""Inception"" flew by at 2.5 hours and was suspenseful a majority of the time. This film does not possess that same feel or intensity. There are moments of intensity, and moments of peril and intrigue, but it's also ½ laced with heart, character, time, and soul. As a father who starts down a rather strange path to leave a formidable, cursed earth on an almost certain to fail journey across the galaxy to help save it, Cooper (McConaughey) deals with multiple types of adversity such as: impossible space catastrophes, physical confrontation with people, emotional confrontation with people, internal struggles with helping humanity and sacrificing his possible life and future with and for his daughter. The internal struggles resonated here with me almost more than the physical, visible dangers. Even after a strange ending that went nowhere near I was anticipating, I found myself thinking about the Cooper's sacrifice and choices hours later. I was at first ruling out multiple viewings just based on run time alone, but after reflecting on it a bit, I may have to revisit this in the future.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

When I saw that Hans Zimmerman was providing the Music Score, I was saying, looks like another Batman movie taking a trip ie seeing it a few times. By golly did it live to its name, ie the Music. The plot was kinda difficult to portray more so my lack of knowledge of the Physical. Earth basically is running out of resources. So Cooper(McCounaghey) along with TARS(Irwin-voice) - the most adorable thing. heeheh, Instantly fell in love with him. hehehehe, Brand(Hathway). Romlliy(Gyasi), Getty(Grace). Cooper leaves behind, Murph(Foy(10yrs), Chastain(), Burtsyn(ODLER)), Tom(Chalamet(15yrs)Affleck()). At the beginning of the film, we see videos. Now I suspect these were the people who either survived or lived trough or whatever the Dust Storm back in the hey day. Cooper heads up on the mission as recruited by Professor Brand(Brand's Daughter(Caine)). He however as we later learn, forgot to mention One titchey weenye thing. And that is, THEY NEVER COME BACK. There're mission or so they understood, was to find a place to get back. While they are on the mission, they encounter Dr. Mann(Damon). Who later reveals to em the truth, and tries to sabotage the plan. The plan was that they start Civilization on the new planet. And to FORGET about Earth. Cooper was given a choise of ""You might have to decide between seeing your children again and the future of the human race."". Another thing, I have to mention were the VIEWS. Oh it was heaven.

Some scientists must be thinking about finding another planet. Would like to hope that millions of generations can still survive here, but I do have my doubts. I thought the reactions between Cooper and Murph was fantastic. Am sure many would harbor a grudge against a parent leaving them even if for outer space.

","This is the story of Cooper and his daughter Murphy. Cooper is a space pilot, at a time when the world needs farmers more than pilots, as the Earth is dyeing and people starve. Cooper is a dreamer, dreaming of the times when ""we used to look up wondering about our space in the stars as opposed to looking at our place in the dirt"". Cooper thinks os being chosen by some mysterious entity to undertake a journey beyond human capabilities, a response to a call to save mankind. This journey will force him to abandon his family and especially his daughter Murph, and will take him along an incredible ride across space and time. The adventure is in itself epic, but what makes it even more engrossing is that the three main themes of the movie (the interstellar trip, the relationship between a father and his daughter and the underlying theme of time) are merged into a story with a wide breadth and with many human touches which make the story highly emotional. Nolan plays very creatively with the theme of time: he bends it, he makes it work like the famous Escher drawing (two hands drawing each other): Cooper is allowed to experience time as a physical dimension, where the past is a mountain to climb and the past is a canyon; but, unlike what he thought, he was not the one that was chosen, Murph was the one chosen to save mankind, and he was just the ""bridge"". All this makes of Interstellar much more than ""just"" a sci-fi movie, though it remains a great example of its genre. Clearly it taps into some some of the iconic all-time sci-fi movies, specifically 2001, but it deserves a space on its own in the firmament of the great fiction movies. Personally, this is one of the movies I have put right at the top, in the Olympus of my most loved movies ever.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

This was probably the only time that I cried in a sci-fi movie like I was watching some love drama, this is extremely touching and poetical! The Visual Effects Oscar was well deserved because the space scenes that this movie delivers are absolutely amazing, not only the ones in space even the shots on Earth were beautiful, but giving this only a Visual Effects Oscar is unfair, and this shows how great this movie is, the fact that even though it got an Oscar still wasn't enough, this deserved Best Picture and Best Director Oscars as well. The main theme soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is probably the best I've ever heard in my life and I think the Best Soundtrack Oscar should've been given to this movie as well, listening to that sound create so many different feelings, is really a masterpiece!
Nolan's work was flawless and you really can't ask more from a director, technically speaking this is perfect.
The narrative and that plot twist were also one of the most remarkable ones in the history of the cinema, and to me personally this is one of the greatest stories a movie ever told, this movie is about humanity, family, love, evolution, science, space, survival, perseverance, really this movie has it all and that fact alongside an unforgettable visual experience will forever make this one of my favorite movies of all time!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

First, the writing (Chris + brother Jonathan) is astonishing, allowing us to see the motivations, fears, pain felt by each character, especially Murphy in three age periods, which hits an older audience esp hard. Being reconciled after a lifetime of loss was a holy moment for both Murph and Cooper.
Seeing the effects of ""ghost Cooper"" taught many viewers a quick lesson in causality, which is mysterious, even supernatural. Cooper's decision to go or stay with great loss either way? An impossible decision. A lie convinced him to go.
The music by Hanz Zimmer, performed in a cathedral on a giant pipe organ, a work of genius.
Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, with the vast crop fields, alien planet vistas, cloudscapes, beyond beautiful.

On the heels of that, if we are so far into the future that cryo-sleep exists, why are there not electric vehicles instead of continuing to use gas-guzzlers? That kind of struck me as being rather inconsistent. Again, this and many other questions go back to the issue of not having an adequate enough back story on what has happened with the planet, to say nothing about why society is now determined to follow that ridiculous conspiracy theory that man never landed on the moon/flew any space missions ever.

","I went to see Interstellar excited to see both a sci-fi film and the new Christopher Nolan film; I left feeling as though I hadn't seen a film at all but nearly three hours worth of undeveloped characters stumbling from one inexplicable and unnecessary plot twist to the next. Nolan intentionally keeps many of the details of his future world hidden, however, is so clumsy with the details that he does provide that by the end of the film the plot comes together to seem like an utter farce. None of the characters are developed enough for the audience to identify with them and as a result the numerous and lengthy close-ups of teary eyed individuals is tedious and tiresome. Many capable actors are kept to only a few relatively insignificant lines but then later reveal massive plot shifts only moments before being killed off. This drastically reduces the emotional impact of the film despite how clearly Nolan is trying to tug at the audience's heart strings. Even the pace of the film (typically a strength of Nolan's) is way off. Much like Inception and the Batman series, Nolan whisks the story along inviting you to forget one or two potential plot holes in order to keep the audience engaged. However, in Interstellar, the plot holes are far too big to ignore and the fast pace often ends with a dead-end plot development. It feels as though Nolan is rushing through individual sequences just to land his plot right back where it started. By the third act, the audience is left wondering what was really accomplished by the first two. The greatest let-down of the film comes at the crescendo, with the audience eagerly awaiting at least some explanation of the numerous confusing plot twists. No such catharsis is offered because it was never intended. The film ends much as it began, disjointed and seemingly without direction. ",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Earth is dying. There's no moralizing about what we did, but a plague is destroying our crops and our atmosphere. Wheat was wiped out last year and okra is dying this year. Since my lifetime consumption of okra would barely fill a salad plate, I had a little trouble picturing that as apocalyptic. Former astronaut Cooper (McConaughey) stumbles onto a super-secret NASA facility and is recruited for a mission through a wormhole to try to find a habitable refuge for humanity. What does a wormhole look like? Well, since it looks the same from all directions, logically, a sphere. The problem is that the three potential refuge worlds all orbit a black hole, whose gravity is so intense that time slows dramatically. On the innermost, an hour on the planet equals seven years on earth, meaning the astronauts can't dawdle lest time run out for humanity on earth. As one physicist pointed out, a gravitational field that intense would probably rip any planet to bits. The inner planet is a water world with gigantic tidal waves. The explorers come back to find that 23 years have passed on earth. The next planet is an ice world inhabited by the sole survivor of a previous mission who has lost it. Cooper sends his ship and crew off but decides the answers lie within the black hole. Inside he finds a tesseract that can access any point in space and time. He realizes it was built by some vastly more advanced human civilization in the future, and uses it to send information back to his daughter, enabling her to solve the equations that will make humanity's escape possible. Cooper returns and wakes up in a colony orbiting Saturn, where he is reunited with his now-elderly daughter. This is not a very visually arresting film, indeed, it's very monochromatic. But it has a complex and non-linear plot, the tesseract is convincing, and it's a very interesting exploration of the time paradoxes of space travel and their human meaning.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","2001, anyone? That brilliant piece of filmmaking that challenged us to do something that mainstream Hollywood has long since shelved: Think. Use your wonderful brains, people! Remember that films don't have to be simply a means to an end; they can push past our own intellectual limitations, establish beautifully thought-provoking horizons just beyond our reach, and best of all, can be memorable not for what they say, but for what they do. It physically pains me to see promising filmmakers with the appropriate intellectual boundlessness to follow in Kubrick's footsteps pushed to the side in favour of bland individuals with little more than visuals and violence in their creative arsenal. Admittedly, I enjoy my CGI extravaganzas as much as the next guy, and that is why Interstellar is a six-and-a-half-star film in my book. As far as visuals go, it's really, well, stellar. But it is simply too unsatisfying and draws too many parallels with 2001 (without delivering on them) to be considered as anything more.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Watch Fast and Furious 8, or whatever number they are up to. Even I found this hard to follow in the first few minutes. There was some mumbled dialogue, and the farm bits seemed far from 'Interstellar'. But I stuck with it. Was I glad I did. It just kept on getting better and drew you in. The confusing early scenes explained themselves eventually with a fantastic 'Bootstrap Paradox' that was worthy of Dr Who or Star Trek at their best. The spacecraft were real hardware and models just like in the 1990s. Not cartoon ones like we have become inured to in recent decades. The acting was fantastic. Especially from Matthew McConaughey who proved once and for all that he is brilliant. (Mind you I've liked him since Sahara.) This was an epic that I was still thinking about the next day, which is always a good thing. I loved the homages to 2001 A Space Odyssey.

Infact, it is a surprisingly thoughtful and intriguing science fiction pic with a star studded supporting cast of contemporary Hollywood actors that willl keep you riveted to the screen even at 2 hours and 49 minutes. McConaughey offers a subdued and mature portrayal of a father choosing between his children and their future. Gone is the swagger and annoying aplomb that we've come to expect in an endless array of rom coms. It's the fully established relationships that keep you grounded in a story that could easily overwhelm and set you adrift in mind blowing science fiction concepts related to advanced science, technology, spaceflight and time travel.

","(Warning: This article contains plenty of spoilers and reveal the conclusion of the film) Interstellar contains high production value, a beautiful score by Mr. Zimmer, and as least as breathtaking as Gravity. This time Mr. Nolan tells the story without the need of multiple layers (a la Inception), making stupid person like me easy to grasp the plot. But something is not very good with the last 10 or 15 min. of the film. A man flies through 50 years or more, make his return only to see the woman (girl) he loves become an old lady? C'mon, this is EXACTLY THE SAME with a Japanese cartoon movie, Gekijouban Kidou senshi Gandamu 00: A wakening of the trailblazer (Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: Awakening of the Trailblazer, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1726286/). In that Gundam movie, the rendezvous takes place at the 3-minutes extra scenes after the end credit roll. Even bigger issue, I guessed this dated back to Oct. 16th, and no one shook the bookshelf to fore- tell. (you'll know this line after seeing this film) In addition, the space colony at the end of the film is 90% copycat from Elysium, earth surfaces are curved. And I'm quite sure design concept of space colony in Elysium is influenced to some extend from the space colonies in the Gundam universe. (in face, Interstellar can be view as the prequel to the Gundam universe!) Maybe that's why all space station scenes take place in the interior and ext. of space station never shown. Lots of audience fear this film is even more difficult to understand than ""Inception"". This is because they want to gain 100% scientifically correct explanation on what happens if someone falls into the Black Hole. My strategy is, disregard all the hard science terms and enjoy the ride. p.s. Disney may have real problem if they really plans to remake ""The Black Hole"".",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I've seen most scifi movies. This one is very easy to watch if you don't mind long movies. I didn't drift at all during the movie. The dialog was good. Some voice was lost a few moments behind the sound of the movie, but I got the general idea. The script was great IMO. The picture and effects were very well done. Classy but not over the top unbelievable. I liked the cast and enjoyed their performances. The movie was a bit metaphysical at some points but it wasn't beyond all belief. You do have to allow a minor bit of flexibility in your state of reality to truly enjoy this one. But that's what SciFi is all about. A bit of futuristic thinking is required. I watch this one with my 12yo son and he was transfixed all the way through. And very animated after the movie ended. We both enjoyed it. Reminded me a lot of the ""Odyssey"" movies. I've read a lot of the lesser reviews and I can say those reviewers seem rigid and inflexible and unforgiving of a lot of aspects in the movie that don't really stand out as flaws IMO. I highly recommend this one on the big screen or IMAX. I'm a scientist and didn't find any of the effects to ridiculous to imagine. Please watch. Don't be fooled by the Haters.

18 November 2014,haosstoposto,7," Too much hype, typical for a Christopher Nolan movie
","As a sci-fi fan I must say that I expected more from this movie but as usual the hype was too strong, and it still is, considering the IMDb votes. Some movie critics compared this movie with 2001: Odysee in Space, but it is not so remarkable. I will not say much about the story but there are some classic sci-fi motifs incorporated into it, like themes of dying Earth, exploration of deep space and the ways to do it with simple rockets, wormholes, time-dilatation, time-travel and some humanocentric ending. All these sci-fi (or science) concepts are for themselves fascinating and tantalizing, but the overall result of the movie is underwhelming. It's hard to pinpoint what went wrong, but some ingredient in the movie is missing. Perhaps it was all too much at the same time. On the bright side, the human element of the story is nicely done and we see how much of a sacrifice exploration and distance, both in space and in time, can be. Many things were obvious in the movie, for example betrayal of dr.Mann, and perhaps it should have been done in some different manner. And of course, it is not clear (at least not to me) how and why data from the inside of the black hole helped Humanity to survive doomed Earth. So, all in all we have some mediocre sci-fi movie pretending to have some hard physics in it. Sometimes it is exciting, and at the times it is boring.

On the other hand, I was intrigued by the aspect of ageing as a consequence of gravitation and acceleration and how this is incorporated in the script.

","So I just watched Interstellar now for the second time on blu-ray, and I think I have an idea, why there is a big hole in the movie and how it could be avoided. On the extras of the bluray they don't stop pointing out how scientifically accurate interstellar is, but at one point they throw all logic over board, and I don't mean the trip in the black hole. Its just after they leave the worm hole and consider which planet they should visit first. They go for the one thats closest to the black hole and were time runs 60.000 times as slow as on earth. thats one hour in seven years. But if this is known to the crew, wouldn't everyone go for the other planets first, even if it would take months to get there? secondly if the time on the planet runs so slow, wouldn't the gravity be several magnitudes higher, so that nobody could walk around there? and would time go as nearly as slow in the capsule in the orbit as on the planets surface so the left behind crew couldn't grow old so quickly? My solution for this problem is, just cut out 15 minutes where they visit the water planet, re-film a short sequence in the capsule where they decide to go to the ice planet first and everyone is fine. The could explain that murph got old just by explaining that time slowed down for them when they passed the worm hole. By cutting out the water planet, Intestellar would lose its largest logic hole, would get a bit more focused pace and make it to the end credits in 150 minutes. another thing is the use of the imax camera. it produces magnificent pictures and the mobile version was even small enough to film inside cars. but why didn't they use it for the whole film? now we have the annoying switching from letterbox to imax and back. next time i would like to see a complete scifi flick in imax.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nolan does it again man and am even more a Nolan fan now. It's another mind-bender from him, where he forces audience to think and reason. I like the fact that while mostly based on proved scientific theories the movie later suddenly falls into the philosophical/mind-bender genre like Nolan's many other movies. The movie feels a little slow in the beginning but it slowly builds up and ends on a great note. The father- daughter relationship works most of the times, and some of those times it is very emotional. People say his movies lack heart and emotions. He proved that wrong with this one. Those scenes with Matt Damon on that planet are very thrilling though also a little confusing because of Matt's character's ambiguous intentions. And that scene where his character gets part of the Endurance destroyed and Cooper attachs to the destroyed part is extremely well done. Hans Zimmer's score over all and particularly in that scene deserves high accolades. He succeeded to bring a totally new sound to the move, even though there were places where it reminded me of the extraordinary and his best in my opinion score of Inception. Loved that scene with those tall waves too. Loved the depiction of worm and black holes, especially that of black hole is so beautiful and mysterious. I wish they had shown more of it (see my comments next). The plot is quite complex. There is lot of science involved. And because of our limited understanding of that level of science at points it seems there are plot holes while there are actually not that many. And especially after he dropped into the black hole it all suddenly becomes so very confusing and at the same time so very away of the scientific theme of the movie before that. It falls in that metaphorical/philosophical genre. It's here where it has a lot common with Inception. Like Inception the movie had me thinking after it was finished, and require multiple viewing to grasp it entirely, which again is a triumph for Nolan, I believe. Acting is top-notch. Matthew was great overall, he nailed the emotionally scenes particularly. I have started to like the guy now.

","In European eyes this movie starts out as a too American-çliché story. Coop is an Elvis lookalike farmer with a conspicuous drawl, a Nastasia Kinski lookalike daughter and a rusty father (John Lithgow. They live - surprise, surprise - in a cabin-style farmhouse on the prairie. The first 30 minutes have such a strong John Wayne feel to them, one almost expects Coop to ride into the sunset on a horse instead of a truck towards a secret Nasa base. A hard-to-believe Hollywood-style coincidences lead to McConaughey heading a critical mission to faraway planets save the earth. Coop is guided to a secret NASA base via gravity waves in his daughter's room, then gets asked to lead a mission to save mankind the next moment and whoosh... we find ourselves on a foreign planet. If this movie wasn't taking itself so serious, it's almost a parody. A real crisis then happens when the explorers get hit by a Tsunami. Yes, a Tsunami. Somebody in the scenario writing department has been watching too much CNN news at that time. Because of a time speed difference, 25 of earth years pass. An emotional scene happens when Coop views the accumulated messages from earth. A next planet has to be chosen. Dr Brand has fallen in love with the astronaut that was sent to one of the planets, and proposes to go there. The astronaut on that planet goes insane, exit love interest. The planet was uninhabitable anyway, as he duped them in believing it was a paradise. As this exploring seems to be sort of a family business, meanwhile on earth, the scientist who started all this, who is also her father dies. A similar father-daughter thin happens when Coop reaches his daughter, who also has become a space scientist, at a young a age via the fifth dimension. He then tells her the clues to time travel via black holes via morse code on an analogue watch which she finds in her old room 30 years later. They find a greener planet. Mankind is saved. Why Coop is able to travel though time, pushing books from shelves on earth while in another galaxy but unable send through a piece of data? I have no clue. Questions, questions. Not unusual for an unintelligent space movie rated 5,4 with too much focus on cheap emotion and too little on a credible story. But I got interested because of the 8,5 rating. Strange.

It needs more farmers.. We didn't run out of machines.. We ran out of food.."" He's damn serious.. That time is not too far.. We are moving rapidly towards that state.. When the teacher says to Cooper, ""Tom is doing very good.. He'll become a great farmer.."" I was astonished to see almost the entire audience bursting into laughter.. As long as, the society laughs at a well educated farmer, we are going to become extinct, no matter how many life sustainable planets we move to.. In the movie, Cooper was depicted as one of the best farmers.. Because, he was well educated.. He was an engineer in the past.. All his farming machinery were automated by him.. People don't see that.. I don't see the whole movie as a fiction.. I see only the part of interstellar travel as fiction.. The events happening on earth are not fiction.. Nolan has addressed the global climate change issue.. He's trying to tell us, what we are gonna make out of this planet.. I wish people can understand that and act responsibly.. At last, a huge bow to the great artist, ‪ChristopherNolan‬ for making this great artwork.. Moral of the movie: We cannot go to another life sustainable planet unless someone places a wormhole inside our solar system, that leads to another life sustainable planet..

That scene reminds me of the early cubist work of Picasso and Broque. Both instances are representative of multiple points in time being depicted simultaneously. It's important to understand this is mostly interpretive. The movie does go out of it's way to explain what's theory and what isn't.

","I mean by this time we all know Christopher Nolan is one the best at what he does. This movie moved me so much, form beginning to end i felt like i was part of the story, the acting was amazing, the actors all fitted their role perfectly and you could really see how much time went into the making of this movie. The whole thing about sandstorms might be boring but it added such an amazing grizzled finish to it. You could see the regret Murph had when Cooper actually left and she was still angry at him. And all these other emotions that tied in so well with each other. The whole aspect of 'time' has always been something Christopher Nolan is interested in, he translates time into words and video which makes it so beautiful to look at if that makes any sense. The shots in this movie were just amazing, all of them but especially the ones in space and on the other planets. Perfectly enough people died throughout the movie to keep me on the edge of my seat. I really loved how Murph was also helping Professor Brand, this made the subplot on earth also interesting. I wasn't bored when they went to the subplots because they were all equally interesting to watch, there weren't to many which i hate because then at the end they don't have enough time to address and finish all the the subplots it's just an amazing perfect movie. It might be long but i feel like it should be. The storyline was interesting enough for me to watch it till the end. And wow the end... I guess i should've known that he was the 'ghost' but i didn't and i don't know why? The end made me bail my eyes out. And it's been long since that happened from a movie. The only little thing i didn't really get was WHY he needed to go to space? If i were him i would not have gone with the little information he got. He didn't know how long he was going to be gone? He didn't know if the 'Aliens' (if i can call them that) were like an actual thing. But i'm glad he did because otherwise the movie would've been real boring!

And this is exactly the feeling I get from the very beginning of the movie. I can picture the feelings that father has for his children, I can feel his eagerness to explore and emerge out of the shell life has forced him into. I can feel the tension and the heartbreak and all stages of grief Murph goes through, the immense love she had for her father that exceeds time and space just like Brand believed the case with Edmunds.

This story deduces a true father-daughter relationship that really crosses time and space.Although the theme of ""love through time and space"" has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy online novels, this film can make people cry, because it is so pure and true, so similar to our lives.Cooper does not have the ambition of ""my journey is the sea of stars"", but only wants to complete the task as soon as possible to return to her daughter to accompany her growth.In the autumn of human survival, Murphy's final choice of safe haven is still the place with the most memories of his father.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I know that Nolan's fans will disagree with me, but there is no chance that a real and experienced movie fan-or ""cinefil"" if you prefer - can find this cinematographic creation as interesting and magnificent as some of its viewers obviously lacking enough movie experience and knowledge may do. Let me start with a simple question: What is ""interstellar"" supposed to be? Science fiction? Excuse me but then its 95-99% pure fiction and only some little part of it science. Well i wouldn't mind it at all if a. it was not taking its ""scientific"" elements that serious, and/or b. It was using them for conveying some really original humanistic messages we had not already seen in a movie before. And that brings us to its supposedly tender and humanistic part: The father who has to sacrifice himself to save the world and his children and after a journey to the outer cosmos comes back to earth to find out that his present,future, and past are interconnected and that the short time his journey lasted counted as decades of earth years, so his beloved ones are either dead or dying over aged persons etc. etc... Did you find it touching? If yes, you should have found convincing the way the plot flows in the film. Have you? Well, i didn't at all. The strange events (f.ex the messages through the sand lines) and the arbitrary way they bring the ""father"" to the secret space center where he finds out that he is meant to fly the interstellar spacecraft, and then the arrival to the planets and the -scriptly redundant- adventures there, and then the... return to earth through the black hole and a multidimensional universe to a world where time (future-past-present) and space are all mixed... sorry i just couldn't buy it. And the thing is that in spite of the fact that i was not expected to either, the ""scientific"" information was there too, obviously as a pretext of how -wannabe- scientifically explained the whole story was... As about the humanistic/sentimental part, too flamboyant, too melodramatic,too banal: In ""Bicentennial Man"" Robin Williams had already seen his beloved ones aging and dying too. To make a long story short, i think than Nolan fell again in the trap of a too made up, too flamboyant, too ""i'll say everything in a single film"" style,too complicated, too wannabe impressive,unique and original script, involving a film that wanted to be the ""2001 space odyssey"" of our time, but it only said things we have already seen or heard in other films before,moreover through an overloaded script which meaning to say too much, made no sense at all in the end.

28 April 2015,jhtate,10," To Touch the Face of God
","Interstellar was stellar on so many levels. It gave much to ponder and reflect upon. I write this as review of the film from a biblical worldview, which I believe can be done with integrity and without compromising the meanings of the film. First, there is a world in need. Then, a savior is chosen. There is a longing to go, see, discover and save, innate in this chosen savior. He leaves his home to journey to another world to save the world. Then, for me at least, greater connections begin. There is a wormhole. This shows us a glimpse of God in Scripture, as in Psalms 90:4 - ""a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past"" or 2 Peter 3: 8 - ""with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."" We arrive on Planet 1 - a world of water. It brought to mind Genesis 1: 2 where ""the earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep."" Water is the source of life, yet death comes on this planet. We go to Planet 2 - a frozen world, an age of ice. There is no life here. It brought to mind Sheol, the place of the dead. Here, resides an enemy, yet it is a fallen man, a trickster, one who masquerades in the light. This man was once the hero of many. Now he has become corrupted and become a living death. The savior then begins to save. The fallen man, the trickster, is defeated. Yet there is a greater salvation in the sacrifice our savior brings. He gives of himself, he lays down his life for his friend, falling into darkness itself, a black hole. He goes into ultimate darkness. And it is there, that his transformation takes on greater shape. A resurrection begins. He makes his true discoveries. That true life exists outside the boundaries of space and time. That the further we go out, the further we go in to discover true love. The love of a father for his child. That the father will do whatever it takes, to cross space and time to reach and connect with his child. And that this is possible. In this we can discover many things for our own lives. We can journey to try to touch the face of God in the cosmos, yet we see this most clearly in love for another human being. We can witness, the story of the Bible, God's love for us in crossing across time, space, flesh, and death itself to come to us, communicate with us. At the end of Interstellar, our savior hero is not old, his flesh has not begun to decay. It is as if he is reborn. He has new life. The purpose and the journey continue. A new adventure begins. Restoration has happened; it is a new world. Interstellar, I believe, shows well in a movie, the biblical story of creation, fall, redemption, and restoration. And it is very good.

I first saw it in grade 7 on a small TV and No other film I've ever seen has had this much of an impact on me as a movie critic and filmmaker. This movie is visually stunning, emotionally-charged, and powerful. I love it more & more every time I see it and it, and it is a masterpiece of our time. If visual storytelling, screenwriting, or music composition is your thing... this is the movie for you! Hans Zimmer has created an emotionally resonant score to hit you in the feels unlike any other film. Christopher Nolan directed the heck out of this movie and did a phenomenal job. The performances are outstanding, life-like, and painfully realistic. This film HAS inspired and WILL inspire filmmakers for decades to come. I understand that many people don't like this movie because it was boring and/or WAY too long, but movies can be for many purposes... you can go to the movies for explosive and mindless fun or you can go to the movies for an emotionally realistic escape into the future with philosophical themes about human connections, love, and perseverance.

It is a good movie with an interesting and unique concept and is to be watched intensely to ensure you pick up on the subtle elements that have a bearing on the story. As to miss one element could result in a loss of understanding later on which could ruin the experience Nolan is trying to create.

22 February 2017,yvonneshusband,7," Should be titled Star Trek: Interstellar!
","Due to the legion (apparently!) of cinematic (and televisual) ignoramuses who insist that each successive Nolan movie is a greater masterpiece than the previous one, the more educated viewer is required to treat popular (and no small amount of critical) opinion on Nolan's films with scepticism. 'Interstellar' is a case in point. Cutting to the chase: (a) An artificial wormhole that leads from our part of the Galaxy to the other side is straight out of 'Deep Space Nine'. (b) Love as 'wormhole' connecting us with events in our past; again straight from the premiere of DS9. Arguably, the stunning DS9 episode 'The Visitor' examines this same idea to even greater effect. (c) A more advanced form of life intervening in the development of a less advanced one, possibly due to the former having evolved from the latter: DS9 again. (d) Using 'technobabble' to reduce the 'inertial mass' of a space station so that it can be moved closer to the wormhole: DS9 again. (e) Baseball is Benjamin Sisko's favorite sport; the game features in multiple episodes of the show. Although the baseball breaking the window of the house on the space station wall is a beautiful touch! To be sure, 'Interstellar' doesn't confine its 'borrowing' to 'Star Trek'; the explanation of how a wormhole works is lifted directly from 'Event Horizon'. The ending is reminiscent of the 60s movie 'The Time Machine'. Bottom line: like most sci-fi movies, it's neither startlingly original nor deeply philosophical. In fact, the TV show it 'borrows' so freely from did a far better job of presenting the idea that 'love...transcends time and space' than Nolan does here (Anne Hathaway giving what must surely rank as one of her worst performances ever, to boot). If that example of how the 'great' Christopher Nolan couldn't rise above the directorial standards of a TV show isn't bad enough, the execution of the movie's 'celestial temple' sequence, where Cooper communicates with Murph across time, must surely demonstrate to anyone but the most fanatical Nolanite how poorly Nolan ranks as an employer of visual storytelling; the presentation of multiple instances in the timeline of the room could have, and with a better director would have, allowed the audience to infer that the spiritual connection between Cooper and his loved ones was acting as the 'bridge' between him and Murph without Cooper having to baldly say so! This could have been achieved (and this is only one example!) by presenting more of the room's timeline through shots of the earlier stages in the daughter's life, with her mother as an infant, as a toddler with Cooper and her older brother, etc. Interestingly, for a film that asserts that 'love...transcends time and space', none of the characters have any photographs of their departed loved ones! Of course, maybe Nolan simply underestimates the intelligence of his audience and therefore feels it necessary to 'tell' them what's going on instead of 'showing' them, ironic considering how Nolanites consider themselves to be on a higher intellectual level than the average moviegoer. This movie goes absolutely nowhere that other sci-fi movies or TV shows haven't already gone before.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Nolan is undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of our times; his masterpieces have sparked a number of similar (though all inferior) works and he has inspired (and will continue to inspire) generations of talents. The worshippers of cult flicks will remember him for ""Memento"", the mind psyche group will revere ""Inception"", while I believe he will establish his place in the cinematographic hall of fame with his Batman series and this movie - Interstellar. The world described here is a bleak barren land going through a global scale of desertification. Mankind has been reduced to pathetic beings facing famine and starvation as a constant threat. Dreams and aspirations are luxuries and the dreary daily battle with dust and sandstorms as well as dwindling agricultural produce make this a drawn-out version of living hell. Our chief protagonist is an explorer and adventurer who, like a fish out of water in his present existence, jumped at the one chance of saving the world by doing what he does best. As expected, this turns out to be an introspective and revealing odyssey putting humanity to the test. Thanks to the almost-too-smooth twist of the plot, the ending was brighter than what we thought it would be. Do not miss TARS the robot - providing the necessary mirth to dissipate the doom and gloom that might otherwise haunt the movie. The concepts of relativity, black holes, wormholes, 5-dimensional existence, etc. are quite well explained thus digging up physics textbooks are superfluous. This is quite definitely the 2014 film of the year (with only two remaining months to go). Highly recommended.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

My wife and I went to see Interstellar on its opening night at Imax and it had such a deeply emotional and resonating affect that I went to go and see it again 2 nights later with a good friend. Seeing it a second time I realised how much I love this film. It is perfect in every way for me and is now easily my favourite movie of all time! It made me cry just as much the second time and I cannot understand how this was not nominated for best picture of 2014? This film and it's characters connect with the human spirit better than anything I've known; so much so that it has actually changed my way of thinking and my approach to my future and those close and around me. Thank you to Christopher & Anthony Nolan for writing and producing such a marvellous film, and thanks to all the cast and crew who made it what it is. I'm a little tired of hearing about 2001: A Space Odyssey being named and used as comparison in so many reviews I've read. In my opinion Interstellar is masterclass on many more levels and romps all over 2001. This film will resonate with me for many years to come.

10 November 2014,samgreer-694-680740,7," Worth seeing for sci-fi fans
","I consider myself a sci-fi fan. This film had pleasant and unpleasant surprises. For one, the fairly-well established backstory seems to indicate this film is set some time in the future. The set, however, is remarkably devoid of any futuristic devices and improvements at all. A farmhouse from 1975. A Dodge Ram from 2000, and a NASA spaceship from way in the future?? Everything on the set is from present day, every car, building, laptop, and with the amount of books in Murph's bedroom the set almost seems to be from the past. I mean what kid has any books today, much less in the future? This kid has a library in her room. That disparity was a bit of a disappointment. Pleasant surprises included the cast for me as I had no idea Michael Caine or Matt Damon were even in the cast. This is EASILY McConaughey's best work and the only other work he's done I enjoyed as much as this was A Time to Kill. There is a scene with Matt Damon that absolutely scared the poop out of me and everyone in the theater. Fantastic production with no expense spared. And other than the ""threat to the planet"" theme and absolutely, shamelessly STEALING a scene directly out of Event Horizon, this film scores good originality points (although I think I've seen a Twilight Zone with a similar theme) Last unpleasant surprises include Anne Hathaway and her acting. She has the acting depth of Daphne from Scooby-Doo and I dread seeing her cast in anything. Overall there is just too much overall in this movie. Its like Indiana Jones meets Star Trek as the protagonist overcomes insurmountable challenges too often and too frequently. The soundtrack is loud enough to wake the dead and that always seems to be a crutch to give impact to weak scenes. It's not needed, the scenes are not weak. They are intense, often too frequently, and the loud sound is unnecessary and undesirable. The resolution is original, but VERY unbelievable unless you're 9 years old. It REALLY puts the FICTION in science fiction, which was disappointing since the gravity of the problems on Earth and the moral and ethical questions pondered in the film would be lost on a 9 year old - so why the Saturday morning cartoon ending? If you're going to make a film for adults, please make the entire film, including the resolution for adults. I can handle it I promise. Lastly, there is a bit of the ADD scene hopping I first noticed in Oculus. Just stop. Stop doing that forever. The flashing back and forth between a farm and another galaxy with the speed of a music video only insults me as you clumsily attempt to beat me (your viewer) over the head with your sledgehammer of juxtaposition. Please stop making films for morons. If they can't figure it out, they'll never miss it, but its getting borderline offensive for normal IQ patrons. For all these reasons I gave this movie a 7. MY GF is not a sci-fi fan and did not like it. I better qualify that as a 7 for sci-fi fans only!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2020,atacanyldz,9," An incredible movie by Nolan
","I watched the movie for the first time is four years ago and I watched it again two days ago. I can say the first time I couldn't understand well because it's a long movie and you really should think about all scenes but the second time I watched the movie very carefully and again I was impressed. When I had seen Nolan's name I've been curious about the movie because other Nolan's movies are well-known also very good but that movie different from the others. It is Nolan's masterpiece.
First of all, Movie's musics are well-prepared by Hans Zimmer. You can really feel all emotions which are movie wants to give to you. In the majority of the movie's scenes, we are in the darkness and endless space. You feel scared, tense, and a lot of other emotions. Musics can support these emotions such as Cornfield Case. It is one of the main musics of the movie and whenever we listen again in the movie we've got goosebumps.
Moreover, the flow of the movie is also another good point. From the beginning of the movie, everything has integrity and every details depend on other details, and these things create a powerful structure of the movie. Obviously, it isn't an easy movie for audiences. You must follow the plot carefully if you miss any point, you might don't understand some ideas about the movie. Also, I suggest that you should watch the least of twice.
Finally, the cast of the movie is very of good quality. We can see Matthew McConaughey as a headliner and according to my idea he has a really important effect on the success also there is a lot of famous actor in the movie like Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon, Michael Caine. All of these actors have a lot of experiences and everyone knows their skills. They show us every little emotion and important points with their acting.
To sum up, I can say this movie is one of the best movies which is I have ever seen. It isn't short or easy maybe you cannot understand when you have watched of the first time but after the second time you are gonna be impressive and you are gonna say ""Wow"" at the least I said that. I don't know when a new film shows up like Interstellar. It was really good I really do like it and thanks to all employees who work on this movie.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Wow! This movie was so horrible that I needed to add a review, but adding a review required an account, so I did that too just to share my opinion about this Alice Goes To Wonder Universe crap. I've enjoyed almost all of Nolan's movies especially Batman series, but I have to say that with this film, he is off my list, period. So the story goes like the typical Hollywood bs, some random farmer/hacker/drone expert/pilot/father/emotionally balanced/wise guy just discovers some weird gravitational anomaly that leads him to some really hidden NASA headquarters where they plan a save the world mission but they did not have a pilot, but they are in luck because of Mud, who happens to be a pilot and so they set to save the world in a 20th century rocket combined with a very high-tech space ship that will blow you away but not them cause they are in cryo-sleep. Next mission objective is to fly trough a warm hole which you know in theory that it is created only when the space-time is bended due to enormous gravity, but they are bullet-proof so they have no problem passing trough it with their gravity proof suits. Can you imagine that? I can't. So they pass miraculously trough it and are plain bored, they have seen the show already, its like watching a game of football on a boring Sunday. So they arrive at this planet which has water on it but due to the gravity swings a tsunami just appears and they have to save their lives, where are the bullet-gravity-proof suits when you need them? So the rest boils down to the same fairy tale that's been going on from the start of the film, well they could just put Santa in the movie and still be credible. So, enough is enough, I will not waste any more time on this review as you should not waste yours on watching it. A walk in the park or a good book suggested by the other real reviews in here will make your day far more better. So, sadly, turn out that Idiocracy is not far away. 8.7 to this peace of crap?

4 August 2018,austinfromdahood,8," Interstellar: Amazing even with its major flaws
","After a while, Christopher Nolan decided that he wanted to make a space film, maybe something as big as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Everyone was hoping that Interstellar was going to be the next 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but it's not. Interstellar is not a perfect film. It has a good amount of flaws, but it is still an amazing film. Let's start with the amazing performances. Matthew Mcconaughey has one of his best performances in this movie, and the emotion he expressed in this film actually made me cry at times. The actors that play the character Murph (the actors played younger and older versions of this character) had riveting performances and she also made me cry at the emotional moments. The cgi in this film gives me chills thinking about it because all the space and planet sequences looked so real and beautiful, it's probably one of the best cgi used in any film EVER! The story is about finding a new habitable planet, but the real theme of this movie is love. Matthew Mcconaughey's character had the choice of either finding a new planet and leaving his life behind, or staying with his family and letting the earth turning inhabitable. He chose to find a new habitable planet, and he and his daughter being apart, and him eventually regretting his actions has such a great emotional impact. The emotional impact in this film is probably the best aspect of this film, and this is one of the best emotionally driven Christopher Nolan films. But sadly, there is a handful of flaws. Matthew Mcconaughey was accompanied by other astronauts on this mission, and I did not really care about them or their backstories at all. Anne Hathaway plays one of the accompanying astronauts, and the movie concentrates more than they should on her, and I wasn't invested in her subplot because I cared way more for Matthew Mcconaughey and his daughter. Matt Damon also played an astronaut that was stranded on a planet with malicious intentions, and I even though his appearance is out of nowhere, I really did not care about him at all and I feel like he didn't even need to be in this film. The pacing of the first half is also very slow and at times did drag, but the second half really did escalate and became more of what this movie was supposed to be. I like the second half way better than the first half. Even with its glaring flaws, I still think this is a great film. 4/5",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Did I like this film? Yeah..... Is it great? No not really...... The first half of this film is excellent. We are given a compelling scenario of a dying Earth which forces Matthew McConaughey to undertake a real kinda pot luck mission for what's left of NASA. Character development is quite good, with McConaughey and whatever his daughter's name was. Michael Caine is also true to form and adds a real touch of class. Now I could talk all day about the special effects, they really are great..... Unfortunately, that doesn't really make that much difference to me. Although, the scene with the black hole is pretty cool. Anyway, the film goes along at a good pace and is exciting while developing a story. Unfortunately, the film takes a bit of a negative turn once they dig out Matt Damon, Seriously it wouldn't be the worst call in the world to turn it off at this point. The film tries to become more clever then it actually is. If you're one of these people that is going to think I'm just picking holes in the film unnecessarily then just look at the title of the film person! It's called Interstellar! They travel between galaxies so it should be Intergalactic! I like that the film tried something different so I won't slate it or anything, just the idea of love seems very cheesy in my opinion. I feel the film would have worked much better if the underlying question was do you believe in God etc. As in we're faced with the choice of do you believe God put us here and that we should stay, or that it's purely scientific why we're here. If you've seen the film Signs then you get what I mean when Mel Gibson talks about do you believe in coincidences or something more. Anyway, a very enjoyable film, has a story, has some good actors and performances, has a really cool robot called TARS and provides us with some cool excitement. The whole time change aspect when they're on the planet with the waves is also very interesting. However, this film isn't perfect and the end isn't as clever as some people think.

","The last feature film ever to be projected on 15/70mm IMAX film with breath-taking and eye- catching cinematography composed with a reinvented Hans Zimmer soundtrack. Christopher Nolan's 9th feature film is a modern sci-fi blockbuster about time travel (the relative theory), humanity, society, evolution, nature, science, life, history and the future of The Planet Earth. Physicist Kip Thorne whose work the screenplay is based on describes the story as ""based on warped space-time – the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans"". Texas native Matthew McConaughey outshines most of the cast as he usually does as Cooper, an NASA educated southern farmer in this epic space journey about saving the world. Some of the impressive shots were right up there with when watching Star Wars for the first time as a young boy. I found myself gobsmacked and just starring at the incredible work cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema produced for this master piece of art. Not to be so surprised as Christopher Nolan used Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977) as well as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Blade Runner (1982) for inspiration for this modern day adventurous science fiction movie. A very intelligent produced film that entertains you, asks questions and will probably make you shed a tear.

","Wandering in space, the ""black hole"" that makes all scientists avoid is like a metaphor of real human nature: people are often not so good beyond what they see on the surface, but they are not as bad as they think. Everyone has seven passions and six desires, as well as selfishness. Therefore, all good and bad are not so simple. The difference is, which is more critical?
Dr. mace, who is alone on the unmanned planet, is waiting for rescue with a glimmer of hope. The long loneliness makes him more eager to see his own kind again. The so-called: stay dead and be young. When death is near, fear gives birth to an unprecedented force, which may be a strong belief to live no matter what. However, the complexity of human nature is also here. There must be boundless darkness hidden in the positive. When too strong desire for survival becomes the ultimate goal of life, good human nature will be squeezed to almost invisible.
When the original ""be good for others"" becomes ""be good for yourself"" generous giving becomes cruel plunder! Compared with animals fighting for survival, human beings have to rationalize their inhumanity.
Since there are people like Max, there will be people like Cooper who are willing to sacrifice themselves. This may be the way to balance the world. When Cooper faces the black hole, the expected impact is also shocking! The fragments that can't be dodged are like innumerable fears inside. When fear is useless, you can only go through them and wait for the results.
A black hole that no one has ever dared to cross is not necessarily an endless abyss, but also the place of dim light. So death is also called ""past life"". People are very fragile, said no; but people are also very strong, desperate valley will open a stubborn flower of hope.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
26 November 2015,Icons76,6," Interstellar makes for great entertaining show, but lacks depth
","I finally watched brilliant director's Christopher Nolan, ""Interstellar"", and, i found it rather enjoyable, extremely well photographed, with a style, and, skills rich of the uncommon finesse, so typical of Nolan's filmography, of which i am such a great admirer. I love ""Memento"", his first major film in 2001, starring a phenomenal Guy Pearce, and, i have seen all the following efforts, always finding them, extremely accomplished, and mature, even when going for more commercial fare, such as the Batman's franchise: in fact, i thought that Nolan managed always to bring his vision, and, his greater talent to the purpose of creating a major movie, aimed to all mainstream audiences, intelligently well made, and, way above the standards, while always maintaining a narration rich of invention, and, creative, innovative visuals, and, most of all, with top notch scripts. I also loved ""Inception"" which had gotten, if i remember, a mixed reception. I found it extremely clever, written with uncommon genius, and, considering not only the more obvious needs of glossy, wide distributed entertainment, but resulting as a great film shot with a virtuoso direction, of mind blowing, and powerful effect, not only presenting an unique, and appalling show, but, also handling feelings, and character's development, with an extremely touching grip. I did not feel as excited, watching ""Interstellar"", though, a movie i did not find bad by any means, but, that, for me, lacked the same profound, powerful strength, Nolan had previously shown, even in the Batman's movies, always so infused with his impeccable vision. ""Interstellar"" feels like a great show, but falls rather flat at the end, lacking emotional, cohesive force, and, feeling unaccomplished, despite its incredibly skilled crew, and, budget, its powerful presentation, and, special effects.I think the script lacks Nolan's usual personal, and, deeper attention to all characters, and, often relies strangely on some solutions, that feel derivative, and, very little original. Again, I will keep it short and sweet, since there are already so many reviews on here, that have said it all already, some feeling the same i have, and many others, who have instead appreciated the show. This movie for me failed to bring the same, unique, great direction, and writing, one would expect by Nolan, and, over all, it feels like since the get go, the main idea wasn't the most interesting, nor the most innovative, and, its further development did not help to make it into the great movie, one would have expected. However, it needs also to be said, that, considering the painful offer, and, the even worse level of production value, and new ideas, found in most American movies, in the past few years, even a not such accomplished, and, not so inspired film, such as ""Interstellar"", does make for, at least, a more well produced, and, entertaining, big budget, genre's production.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

And the music of Hans zimmer added beautifully to the plot. For me this movie is more than just a film, it gives a tribute to all the physicists and scientists who worked all their life to these theories. This cant be compared to 2001- a space odyssey or the Blade runner.For me its a tribute to Kubrick.

The characters are wooden, the pace is like a snail trying to move through molasses, and trivial or improbable comments are promoted as though they were profound realizations. The basic premise is, in a certain debatable sense, philosophical, mixed with a lot of impressive-sounding technospeak. Things are represented as sudden inspirations which should (and would) have been understood long before the journey even begins, as though to remind the viewer that the protagonists are intelligent and clever enough to figure out what in a real world they would have known and taken for granted long before. Seeing all the grovelingly positive reviews, I tend to classify the film as a con job designed to impress a certain kind of viewer with already understood cliches so as to confirm that they are after all as smart as they think they are.

It would have been easy to feel bogged down and overwhelmed by such concepts if done badly, but the director did well to make these stand out to be considered and hopefully that could mean a higher level of thinking for us in the future.

","This director can seemingly do no wrong. He has yet to create a feature length that isn't good to great. This is no exception. Interstellar features a complex storyline that I'm sure will develop with each watch as it delves deeply into physics and time travel. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered or yet to be discovered but it also gave a wonderful story of love, ambition and human nature. What drives us to do what we do and how love conquers all. The visual effects were nothing short of spectacular, and I will definitely need to watch this on a bigger screen (super jealous of anyone who watched it in the cinema!). The camera work was nice as always but the CGI of space and its wonders is what really works visually. Though I do have to give huge props to Nolan again refusing to go half way and to actually use puppets for the robots and real scenery so his actors really are reacting to what they see. Also, the use of real dust for earth was a nice touch. And to use an actual physicist for the groundwork of the science behind the story was such brilliance we should expect from Nolan at this point. The acting was of course spearheaded by McCon's role and his superb performance. This man is also on a great run of late and I look forward to seeing him in future roles, and will be looking to catch up on his past too!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

After the compelling Gravity (2013), Interstellar is perhaps the most gripping space adventure to hit the silver screen. This inter-galactic space saga is bound to achieve a lot more than merely creating new milestones at the box office. The movie begins without much of a foundation but within minutes we get to know that the story is set in the near future with humanity on the verge of getting wiped out. No melodrama here. All the characters seem to be resigned to the fate of turning farmers, abandoning their pre-apocalypse professions. Matthew McConnaghey plays Cooper, an ex-pilot, now growing corn. It is also suggested that mankind does not need engineers anymore but more farmers to feed the remaining humankind. Cooper grapples with his daughter's teacher at the parent-teacher meeting, where the shocked teacher reveals that Murphy had discussed with her classmates about the authenticity of the moon landing. Efforts are being made to wean away people from science. Earth has been turned into a giant dust bowl and the only means of survival seems to produce as much food as you can.

","Difficult not to have any spoilers reviewing this movie, but rest assured. The movie is not bad at all, specially that these days there are so much crap out there that win multiple Oscars, that makes this movie really worth watching. However it is a mixed bag of goodies (as always). for one it does have a core story, inspired heavily by 2001 a space odyssey and 2010 (the parallels are unmistakable), but it also has many scenes that I believe were just shoved in to make it more commercial and fantastic, but completely immaterial to the story. This makes for an almost 3 hour movie. In the hands of the right editor, could have been 100 mins without loosing any continuity or harm to the story. It is jam-packed with factual errors too, but unavoidable when you make a science fiction movie that occurs in our universe! say in Star-trek universe anything is possible, but not when a Texan space-pilot is at the helm in a not too distant future. Acting is good, specially of McConaughey , but please send him to a speech therapist! in the first 45 mins of the movie, I could not understand half of his mumbling. Direction is good too, music is good too, although in the last half hour of the movie I could swear, they were playing Phillip Glass music.

","The interpretations are epic, the script though pulled by the hair, does not take as sufficient random philosophical ramblings and masquerade it with a false sense (semblance) of scientific credibility. Yes,these sequences are all incredible, but convinces us of the effort and the progressed feelings as we watch the film, which does not focus on the improbability of what anyone sees, but on the identification with the adventures and tribulations that the heroes of the film undergo. It is certain that many of the action sequences implied in the film is inapplicable. The fact that someone undertakes the ""job"" of giving them a rudimentary explanation is not bad. The phenomenon of script plausibility, must not annoy us, who have seen all the films of James Bond, of Rambo and Indiana Jones, who shamelessly, and without any sense of logic, can kill about 129 people in various directions, with a single shot. But the fact that makes Nolan's new venture, insurmountable, is that unlike Castaneda – like INCEPTION, this Kubrick –like journey to the stars, is less annoying and certainly visually infinitely richer. In this case we are dealing with a perfectly successful synthesis of Space Odyssey, a film of impending Doom / destruction (Repent!) and a hint of Star Trek exploring movies, with puffs of quantum mechanics randomly quoted as to provide a rudimentary scientific plausibility. The philosophical implications are infinite, the notations and references scattered, the sense of exploring the unknown, is obvious throughout the film and is easily accessible to the emotional appeal of each viewer, either he is a graduate of Nuclear Physics, or merely a high school graduate. The obsession of differing from the classical,linear approach of time, is present yet again, but not to the levels of mental confusion of Inception. Time here is used with no intention to mislead, as it is presumed by science; as relevant and therefore extends, shrinks and expands, the pace imposed by the director for the benefit of spectators and not of the protagonists. But it is also crucial here, as in Shyamalan films(e.g. 6th sense),that only at the end you get to realize the relevance hiding there throughout the course of the film around the unsuspecting viewer (repeat without the intent of misleading the viewer), just to make the synthetic appearance at the end, in a wonderfully - cut finale, that would be envied by Kubrick himself, if he wanted to have consistency in the journey of his (and Arthur C.Clark's) cosmonaut at the black hole of consciousness. The sacrifice of the movie finale for the sake of happy end is not enough to nullify the strenuous effort that lasts more than two hours that passed without tiring anyone... .. This sacrifice could not be justified by the scene of daughter – father reunion or by the interstellar romance that needed more than 125 years to .. ""bloom"", my dear Christopher. And as you have realized, ambiguous endings which leave the viewer to choose what suits him emotionally, are not necessarily bad. Of course here we are not dealing with whether DiCaprio returns home, but whether humanity survives and certainly a Nolan film is far away from depressing Trier's melancholy ......",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

So in my opinion the Academy has 2 options to consider. Reduce the nominees for 5 movies, or increase the space for 10 nominees. In that case I'm sure Interstellar would be there. In my opinion there was just one little problem with this movie. The ""twist"", was not really a twist. It was kind of predictable, which doesn't make the movie worse. It's an amazing concept anyway.

","On my mind. Filling it, rather. Have been thinking and will continue to think, about Interstellar. It is a thing such that at once there are no words at all, and there are all of the words. When we have a feeling we can't identify, or we don't know how to explain, instead of feeling all of it and letting it expand and carrying it through to its end, we find words that pre-exist and force that unknown feeling into the words we already have, requiring it to fit into one word or another, and that becomes the manifestation of our thoughts. This is how language limits most of us, how our thoughts are shaped by the vocabulary available to us. Neil deGrasse Tyson, the master, said that. And so don't read if you don't want, but I thought - why not write out all the feeling in the words I can, as I'm no Shakespeare ready to create a new word for this feeling.

","I don't get the hype for this film. It could have been so much more. The end was less about space travel, and more about unbelievable sci-fi. I like Sci-Fi's that are at least remotely believable. This movie becomes hard to follow at the end with all the sci-fi twists. The character development is fairly good, and for that I rated the movie slightly above average. However, with almost 3 hours, character development should be expected. The visual effects are pretty good, with the exception of the unbelievable near ending. I'm just not sure this movie was worth the 3 hours invested in watching it. If you're a McConaughey fan, you'll probably enjoy the movie.

","This Film Is the best Nolan film to date, I honestly don't understand why there is a lot of people saying that its a waste of time and money, mainly If I were you I would go watch this film and give it your own opinion. I believe this film defines the way movie making should be and how all the plot points are explained during the duration of this film. For example, in one of the scenes right before they enter the wormhole, Romilly asks Cooper to stop the spinning of the endurance, while they come up close to the wormhole, Cooper asks Romilly how a wormhole works, This is where Romilly explains Einsteins Theory of relativity and explains in detail of how the wormhole works and why its in a shape of a sphere which to me made 100 percent sense. This whole film in its entirety is not only about survival and the exploration of space and finding a new home, It also explores the vastness of the humanity that lies within each and every one of us, whether it be despair, fear, confusion, patience, happiness, sadness, regret and above all Love. I give this film a 9/10 because it is great but no movie is without sin, and I can say that there is a lot of scenes where they could have been removed or fixed and made more sense, despite that, the film has a great storyline and it builds up very well to the point where you are almost at the edge of your seat. This film is just gorgeous from beginning to end, very suspenseful, very adventurous and filled with a lot of important accurate scientific information to help you further understand the film. If you are not into the science then I recommend you to just go watch it for the awesome adventure it contains. After all everyone is entitled to their own opinion, even if it doesn't make sense.

7 November 2014,andrew-sciba,7," Already a Director's Cut
","The epic feel of 'Interstellar' comes from its sheer length and scope of events, but the actual impact of the plot line was lacking, leaving me STILL unsure as to whether or not I even liked the movie. It feels like this is a film that the Nolan brothers wanted to make without creative input from the evil movie executives who usually demand edits based on pacing or story/character complexity. In short, it's a director's cut, through and through. Some scenes or plot points were light or jumbled that I stopped trying to figure out what was going on and just let the movie take me for a ride, in which I became more of a spectator than a moviegoer. The development of the movie itself felt a little like ADHD Netflix; first it's Shyamalan's Signs, then 2001: A Space Odyssey, suddenly Event Horizon (softened by the deadpan humor of Dr. Who-esque robots), ending with Luke Skywalker hopping in a small spacecraft with his trusty droid off to find Leia in the Degoba System or whatever. Though 'Interstellar' brings some new story mechanisms into play, like Einstein's relativity and what it would be like to exist outside of time, these devices have been explored thoroughly outside of film - unlike the 'dream within a dream' concept. At the end of the day, the spectacular feel of 'Interstellar' is handicapped by it's lack of solid delivery and plot disconnectivity. It's worth the price of a normal movie ticket, but don't be surprised if you leave the theater scratching your head.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Nolan respects the intelligence of his viewer by allowing the story to open up to them and not just spoon feeding us plot points. There were plot holes and missing information, but not know how a car is built doesn't stop you from driving it. And Intersteller was driven by its acting. This film had all the touches we've grown to love from Nolan, he also pulled from Spielberg in certain moments that worked with the nature of the film, and favored 1997's Contact, but none enough to lose focus on the story.. Did this feel a bit like inception, towards the end, of course it did. The difference was the time put into really ending this story with some closure. This amazing ensemble of actors propelled this film to heights above your typical Sci Fi film. The full circle plot became predictable around the middle of the film, it was all too obvious what was to come, But overshadowed by the amazing performances by Matthew McConaughey, Anna Hathaway, Michael Cain, and the unexpected Matt Damon. It is rare that we see an Oscar winning actor come in midway in the film, deliver, then out, this is something I would like to see more of.

The titles (in Italian, of course) actually helped to keep from losing those parts which were ""mumbled"", an issue I see increasingly in American films.

It is I think the British director's most mature work and it could have been his best picture if not for its disappointing ending.

20 July 2016,notafanof,8," A spectacle to say the least...
","I had waited four years for a good Christopher Nolan film to be released again. Inception is a classic action film that at least sort of gets you to think (though it should be noted that dreams don't work the way they were presented, and yes, I do get that it is a metaphor for filmmaking,get of my back you mouth breathing hippopotamuses), but the dark knight rises is easily the most disappointing film to come out in the 2010's (In my opinion anyway), and it made me question as to whether Nolan was riding a tidal wave of unjustified acclaim. Sure his movies are smart and well plotted, but they are also at times needlessly complex and convoluted and lack human touch. His characters are like robots that are only present to explain the plot. And, so, I have been waiting for a Christopher Nolan to have a characters that act and at the very least speak like normal human beings do. Interstellar is somewhat successful at making the characters feel like human beings. Hell, I can sympathize with McConaughey 's character in the movie because him playing father to the little girl was heartwarming as well as heartbreaking. This definitely is the most emotional of all of Nolan's films. So I can excuse this film for being sappy at times, as it seems Nolan is a newcomer at representing human emotion. Give him time, folks, he'll get the hang of it someday. Like most Nolan movies, the dialogue is on the nose at best, and patronizes us with obvious plot points at its worst. Though, I have to say, this film definitely needed the expository dialogue, as most viewers wouldn't understand the complex ( and at times fictional) science this film portrays. FANTASTIC special effects. The best CGI I have ever seen in a film. It's obvious a lot of effort was put into the look and feel of this film. The score is phenomenal as well, it swells to emotional climax with perfect timing in the movie's best scenes. The story is good, I had to suspend my disbelief at times, but it's still a noble effort at somewhat coherent storytelling. I Loved the ending, which is what I think will make or break the film for quite a few people, but I am a sucker for 2001's acid trip sequence, so, to each their own.

","What a glorious way to demonstrate the richest of the skills of film-making!! Kudos must go to Nolan. It's a sci-fi treat blended beautifully with emotions, an excellent original work in the era of mostly non-original movies. The direction and story is exceptional in many ways and this is what we expect from Nolan. Acting is good, especially, the acting of all the three females is excellent in the movie. Visuals are amazing. Music is good but I expected even better from Hans Zimmer. The expansion of scope for the future of the human race is amazing. Yes, it has some similarities with '2001- A Space Odyssey (1968)' but surely and most certainly 'Interstellar' is a next generation movie. The end part of the movie has been talked about a lot. It is very heavy, very happening and very complex. They say 'Seeing is believing'. The important thing here is that seeing means seeing and understanding it well too. This part is the soul of the movie; it's the part where millions of the scattered dots of the whole movie show how well they are bonded. In order to find what this movie is all about, it is necessary to understand it. For me, especially three things in this end part were very very important- 1) the use of the 'Time' dimension out of the five dimensions talked about in the movie. 2) the role of 'Gravity' as a means to communicate across the dimensions and 3) the position of the humans in a far distant future. The only problem seems to be is the slow pace. This movie is a fine example of the trade-off between an experience of reality in a movie and a good pace of it. I believe that a classic movie of this stature deserves this kind of elaboration and so this pace too. But, from many viewers' point of view, well, the idea may be a bit different.

","(Don't read with you didn't watch it already!) I'm giving Interstellar 4 stars because the detail in space is Horrible, no stars, etc. Originally from the Black Hole Thermodynamics and string theory, the black hole is the entrance into the void (in between each universe following string theory). But when cooper goes into the void or into the black hole, his now apparently into 5th dimension where he can Only see the history about his life but not anywhere else and relating to this, in ""Men In Black 3"", There is a alien named Griff than has 5th dimensional abilities and refers to all history, not only his. The Screen play is horrible and the theme is toooo dark. Something good about it is they made all the technology legit and cool. And inferring from Star Trek (1960's edition), the wormhole looks horrible, since it's too dark to see it, it doesn't even look like they went through it. And another part of the black hole, black holes don't occur often, and the black hole would have enough force to bring all that debris inside, and I'm referring that that black hole occurred from a super powerful supernova mixed with a nebula, the dark energy would also be sucked into the black hole instead of floating around it. Finally, the ending was horrible, the original plan was when Murphy is 30 something, cooper would come back. But after, when he escapes from the 5th dimension black hole, he is just outside of Saturn. Then he is apparently found in a space station where he should of died. The space station is like a museum and the walls flip up. Now you saw why I rated this 4 stars.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Christopher Nolan directed the dark knight trilogy, in my view the greatest super hero trilogy ever. He also directed a fantastic sci fi Dream movie, inception. Perhaps my hopes were too high for this movie, I don't know. The point is, this is a film that wants to be great, but loses momentum. The first two thirds are well put together, introducing us to the characters and setting. The film has some great moments, but sadly nine out of ten of theme happen before the films final act. I call this the Prometheus of Christopher Nolan's repertoire, it falls apart towards the end, with a villain with nearly no motivation bringing the epic spectacle of suspense and mystery crashing down in a fireball of explosions, crummy dialogue and unexplained plot holes. I do not call this movie 'bad' at all. The second act is very well put together, and I was crying in my seat while watching it, hoping against hope that it would all turn out. However, I can't give this any more than a 6, the ending brings up questions and concepts the film couldn't hope to satisfy, and that brings me on to the ending. A disappointing, unsatisfactory conclusion, where if it were any other director everyone would be thinking that they were doing drugs while on script. (Sigh) Interstellar is in no way bad as such, with great acting and superb visuals.

The plot is entirely based on science of Physics, mostly the general theory of relativity and also some M-Theory and a bit of quantum mechanics. It only mixes fiction with science where it is scientifically permissible to do so. Unlike many other sci-fi movies (e.g. Armageddon!!), this one does not blend with religion, does not praise Capitalism and above all it does not sneer at science itself! On the contrary, it rejects beliefs of supernatural, scoffs Capitalism and praises science. I loved the idea that even in a society where science is no longer a necessity in the eyes of the public, still the scientist keeps pursuing his/her inquiries, even importunately insisting upon it in the face of an ignorant joker who is then a school teacher! I did not like the idea that the US government is given a positive role in the story; however, either deliberate or unintentionally, the government is kept out of sight quite deftly.

","For this film we really have to hand it off the the writing, space research, ideas and cg to make new dimensions. The acting was average, all though I was impressed by the young daughters acting. This movie succeed in what Nolan tried to create, which I felt many of the shots were very Kubrick inspired. The exterior space shuttle scenes looked very similar to 2001, and the shots within the warm hole were very much like the special effects of space travel in 2001. Obviously the shot of Matthew McConaughey, screaming and jerking his head in fear is a parallel shot of Dr. Bowman (2001) going into time warp. Hal also had many similarities to the robot assistants in Interstellar. Interstellar was composed of amazing writing, special effects, and an overall new look on our living dimension. The first half of the script which was written by Jonathan Nolan, stayed realistic and gave the audience a good knowing of the characters, the second half, which was Christopher's, seemed to stretch the plot points slightly but it is excusable due to the circumstances of the plot. Nolan's true style was really shown in this movie, for the Batman series wasn't even his idea, Nolan just needed money so that he can make his masterpiece. While I hold this film in high regards, we must not let or excitement for this film blind us from it's flaws. I found that the weightless shuttle scenes seemed cheap and unbelievable. I felt like I could guess exactly where the cords holding them up were, and it seems like the actors were very aware of their harnesses, you could really see the difficulty to act while attached to the ceiling. Nolan tried to do the weightless by himself, and it did not turn out well, we know better can be achieved simply from looking at Gravity. I also found that Nolan really avoided using a tripod for this movie. While the stabilization was smooth, some scenes still could have used a tripod steady shot.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","The only movie that can be better than this one is interstellar 2...at the same time it's larger than life and scientifically possible...best movie ever.Intergalactic portals are breached, timescales bifurcated, science and faith reconciled. Crucially, for all their astro-maths exposition, the constant in both stories is neither time, space, nor gravity, but love. More than once I was reminded of Contact's Ellie striking the outer limits of the universe and breathlessly declaring: ""They should have sent a poet."" In dispatching Nolan beyond the stars, that's exactly what they've done.Despite the clunkiness of its dialogue (would an astronaut really need to have wormholes explained to him just as he approached one?) and ludicrousness of its plot (I can only accept the final 15 minutes if it's all an illusion - which I suspect it isn't), Interstellar is the work of someone who dreams with their eyes wide open. There is no one working in cinema today who has as much faith in the overwhelming power of the image as Nolan and who trusts their audience to be similarly awestruck. Like visionary film-maker Douglas Trumbull (who conjured 2001's most memorable effects), Nolan's primary register is light, and one can legitimately trace his love of celluloid back to the earliest experiments of Georges Méliès, who first used movies to send us on A Trip to the Moon in 1902.

9 November 2014,michaelisariley,9," Why this movie is great, but i still remained a bit reserved
","As a fan of quality cinema and science I am a sucker for Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". This was the first movie to ever depict realistic space conditions; addressing problems such as zero gravity and noticing the silence of space. Gravity attempted to recreate this atmosphere but instead of addressing the silence of space with actual silence the viewer heard blasting music and Sandra Bullock's loud breathing as well as a very memorable instance in which they misinterpreted how physics work in space. In my mind I expected a lot from Christopher Nolan's depiction of space considering how he has stated that he admires Kubrick's masterpiece. In short I wasn't disappointed. The moment the first scene in space took place i couldn't help but smile. Though Nolan did have music to set the tone in some space sequences, Nolan did take the time to show the silence of space. A particularly good instance of this is that in which (Spoiler) the airlock is opened and Matt Daemon's character is imploded along with a good chunk of the space station. This was done is spectacular fashion going from mid-sentence in a character's speech to a sudden then muted explosion. This along with all other space physics and ideas triumphed as the center peace of the film and as a beautiful testament to movies of space. The only reason for not giving this movie a higher rating is a very emotional script witch in my opinion drew away from the science and breathtaking space sequences and then also the heavy symmetry to 2001. As for the emotion carried through the film, it was strong at first with the depiction of the stress felt by McConaughey's character watching the lives of his loved ones pass in front of him in mere moments, but felt as though it were laid on a bit too thick by the end of the film. The similarities to 2001 however were a larger problem for me. With the different dimensional travel, the supposed higher beings guiding them, and other similarities, I became too reminiscent of 2001. For a movie Nolan created so well with so many great things incorporated, I wish he had made a film that was more his own than a tribute to the work of another filmmaker that he admired. In all however Interstellar is a movie I genuinely enjoyed and definitely earned at least a rating of 9/10.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

I actually want to see it again because there were a few parts I'm not 100% sure I understood completely. There are some really intense moments, as well as emotional ones. I quite enjoyed the science being so well integrated into film. It's seamless and it's really refreshing that the plot doesn't have huge scientific holes in it and doesn't stretch too far away from what's possible and what can/could potentially be possible with the unknown aspects of our universe. The acting was excellent. Mathew McConaughey continues to impress me. He has grown so much as an actor and he did a great job with his role in this movie.

","Firstly, please Don't mention the appalling ""Gravity"" in any further reviews of this fantastic movie. This is superior in every way. Nolan and Bro have surpassed themselves, as has Zimmer. The film, though a little too long maybe is absolutely what cinema should be. This is the first genuine work of genius of the 2010s and comparisons to Kubricks 2001 are obviously to be made and rightly so. Kubrick's was ground breaking and now Nolan has created his benchmark. Although different films and journeys they are very similar, both including a staggering jumpcut and fantastic music. Zimmer has also created his masterpiece which takes the movie to another level and gives me goosebumps when i listen to it at home. There's no point in saying anything else really, i will be very surprised if a movie comes out in my lifetime that beats this on every level that Nolan has set for all movie makers around the world.

11 November 2014,Chrismeister,7," The Spectacle of Human Endeavor
","A major theme of Interstellar is how Humanity has lost its naturally inquisitive mind and its sense of adventure. Writer, director, producer Christopher Nolan tries to recapture that on a cinematic level with audiences, reintroducing them to why we fell in love with films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Wars. Many of Nolan's films have captured this sense of awe and wonder in spectators, a main reason to why he has such a beloved following. The Prestige and Inception are the key examples of this; we see characters astounded by inventions, worlds and ideas. Interstellar shows us characters astounded by the great vastness of space and out space in it, someone everyone fears and are drawn to. A usual trick Nolan employs in his films is his use of time. Most evidently in Inception and Memento, but now Nolan has gained access to a narrative structured around the theory of relativity. Any audience member familiar with this will know this film will get complicated. Yet as the film goes on and time becomes more crucial to the plot, the more the film treats its audience like a child. The detrimental fact that has dogged Nolan's films for years is the overuse of expositional dialogue. Near the end of the film, when we are entering 2001 levels of un-clarity, we literally have two characters explain everything. I was completely removed from the experience as this happened, feeling as though the characters were talking to us rather than themselves. This leads to some very Hollywood climaxes. Sometimes not getting all the answers is what makes a story last long after the credits roll, this is something Kubrick understood but clearly Nolan has yet to learn. Despite this, Interstellar is indeed full of spectacle and amazement that any space adventure should offer. It instils both the excitement and fear such an endeavour would have on a person. The wormhole scene solidifies this with a brilliantly nauseating sequence. However my personal favourite shot was when Romilly was given the tropical forest track to remind him of Earth. It plays over a shot of Saturn which was a completely new and unique way of looking at space for me. I fears Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity would undermine the effects of the film, I was mistaken. Nolan has opted for a more classic cinematic view of space. Another clear homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is done throughout the film even in the monolithic shaped A.I of TARS. On the whole the performances were excellent, specifically from Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain. The linchpin to the film is the father/daughter relationship throughout it. If there is any element in this you do not enjoy, the rest of the film will suffer from it. However for me it was portrayed very emotionally and powerfully. And in general all its flaws included this was an impressive spectacle of our place in the Universe and Humanity. This sadly was not the next 2001 however I am more than grateful it wasn't the next Prometheus.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

30 August 2015,CampoReviews,8," A Great Sci-fi Film
","Interstellar is an awesome movie that I've heard a lot of debate about I can understand why people don't like it but personally I really enjoyed it. is Interstellar the best movie of the year 2014? probably not I still got to give that Gone Girl,I still have a few movies left to watch but I can't see anything taking that spot. Anyways back to the movie Great acting overall I really liked the duo of Matthew Mcconaughey and Anne Hathaway, Mcconaughey giving potentially the best performance of his career. I also really liked the robot tars he will be a very memorable character, but I have to say the best acting performance in this movie goes to Jessica Chastain she killed it in her role. I thought John Lithgow Was pretty good as well haven't seen him in a long time. Micheal Caine played Micheal Caine as usual but he seems to be pretty good at doing this I kept feeling like he was Alfred to McConaugheys Batman.lol. sadly though there were a lot of weak performances as well especially by Matt Damon who feels lifeless, Casey Affleck, David Gyasi, and omg the always terrible Topher Grace somebody pull a Paul Walker on this guy and help us clean up Hollywood of its trash. once again lol. The Directing on this film was Great as we have come to expect from Chris Nolan add in some really good writing and production mix in some stunning visual effects and great sound editing with a pretty decent score and you get this a very well made movie which should be enjoyed and not over analyzed. Other then a few weak acting moments, some really loud noises and the runtime, the only other problem I had with this movie was that it suffered from what I call the Lord of the Rings ending, which is when the movie presents many points where it can end perfectly and leave you guessing or feeling good about it but doesn't and just keeps going presenting more questions that you have to answer but you don't know why. I kept feeling like no.... what? end now i like this ending haha overall I recommend this movie 100% worth the watch if you have 3 hours to spare.

8 November 2014,Marc_parry,4," Not the epic it claims to be.
","It's a big film, a big achievement and by no means a bad film but I'm not quite sure what sort of film it is and that's where the problem lies for me. It has elements of all the things I like, at times it's a Hard (ish) Sci-Fi flick with a big budget, big production values and it's all weaved together with a heartfelt simple story of a relationship between a father and daughter, the problem is, in trying to be all of these things at once it manages to be none of them in a satisfactory manner. It's a strange three hours watching because it's a rather schizophrenic piece that constantly flirts with one style after another, never quite making a commitment to what it wants to be. I have have no qualm with films that break the traditional rules of structure or style if it works and I'm more than open to a big blockbuster prizing open peoples minds a bit (I loved the recent Horns that did exactly that with much success and a tiny budget to boot) but here it just didn't work for me because I felt every jerk of style and pace was simply used as padding to compensate for a lack of clear storytelling, it really felt like a bit of 'style of substance' imagery and/or dialogue was slotted in every time the audience started to struggle with the plot or got bored with the visuals. So what's the film about? (Don't worry you'll get no spoilers here) Essentially it pays homage to a lot of Sci-Fi gone by, most notably 2001 A Space Odyssey, big shoes to fill indeed! so is the partnership of Christopher Nolan and his brother as good as Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubrick?...err, no. It's quite simple, this isn't a film about spaceships or relativity, it's a story about a man's love for his daughter and his struggle to be a good dad. That's it, so why the need for all the space travel and science? Well I don't know to be honest, it dabbles with big questions about the meaning of life, the universe and everything but doesn't really touch them because the film isn't actually about the big picture, it's an intimate look at one family's relationships - so why then the constant nod towards showing the massive scope? I'm not sure, it certainly don't give any helpful perspective to the protagonist's plight. Visually this is no Gravity and most of the time the cinematography is well...dull, I saw it in IMAX and with hindsight there was no need because like I say the audience isn't being pushed outwards towards answering the big questions, it's being pulled in and constantly being asked to put the those big issues aside and look at things from a more delicate personal perspective of one man and how it affects his life. If you're expecting big beautiful futuristic images of technology and vistas of space then you'll be disappointed, it's a very low fi look (aside from the youngster pleasing Minecraft style robots which are admittedly rather cool) which may have been intentional to kind of dupe audiences into thinking it's a sincere, intelligent application of science but it's not. This isn't Hard Sci-Fi at all, in fact it's quite squishy and veritably slushy most of the time, Nolan happily puts his science text book down and picks up his copy of Mills and Boon whenever he feels the need to do so (a few moments have Titanic quality dialogue to them) so don't expect anything more believable than an episode of Doctor Who when it come to the science side of things, he just visually fills the screen with a lot of retro 70's looking dials and dirt, almost trying to make you think you're watching found footage of an old NASA launch which I can only assume is to make the more impressionable of the audience think they're seeing something very intelligent going on but sadly this isn't the case. There's no point in trying to make sense of anything and why should you, it's a Hollywood film after all and not a science lecture so just enjoy the (rather dull looking and slow) ride and don't ask questions! this would all be fine if I didn't constantly feel like Nolan was trying to dupe me into thinking that this was some form of profound masterpiece, why mis-sell the film? there's nothing wrong with a bit of 'by the numbers' schmaltz, I've no problem with that but why try to hide it? Hopefully you won't begin to put the jigsaw pieces together until after I did about what's actually happening but you'd have to be pretty slow not to cotton on until the obvious 'and now we explain it all quite vaguely' segment at the end that wouldn't be out of place in an episode of quantum leap. So what is this this film? It's not a big action flick, it's not a realistic piece of Hard Sci-Fi and it's too long and boring to be a relationship piece. It certainly has it's moments with plenty of time in the three hours to find them and it did actually bring me to tears a few times (The introduction of Matt Damon's cameo is just a momentary piece of exposition but it knocked me sideways) The performances are great throughout and the cinematography is well, adequate I guess, it was rather bland and pedestrian to my eye but maybe that's just me. As I say, I don't think it's a bad film at all, just not a memorable one, it's got no guts, no flair and when you take away the mammoth viewing time and ask yourself what the film was trying to say all you're left with is a nice little story about the power and meaning of love that's wrapped up and smothered by a rather silly and inept attempt at a highbrow Sci-Fi epic.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

9 November 2014,rwatt92,9," The Final Frontier
","Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is perhaps his most ambitious and beautiful looking film to date. More importantly, it may be his more heartfelt. The stakes are very high in this movie with mankind being on the verge of extinction due to a new Dust Bowl. Food has become so precious that farmers have become more valuable than engineers. Matthew McConaughey as the protagonist Cooper, a former astronaut laments how mankind as become caretakers instead of explorers. He is eventually called by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), who runs a secret NASA installation, to explore a possible chance for mankind's survival. In doing so he must travel to a wormhole near Saturn for a habitable environment for humans. In this tension to save humanity, the relationship between Cooper and his daughter serves as a microcosm. The day before he leaves they share a scene where the Murphy the daughter resents Cooper for abandoning her. This could have been very manipulative and sappy in another movie however this came of as real and emotional due to the actor's performances. Speaking of which, Matthew McConaughey gives another outstanding performance in his film, who is able to handle the heavy emotions required. Take a scene where he is watching a video feed of his son. Many years have passed on Earth while Cooper and his crew are in space. His son is now showing him his child and is catching him up on what has gone on in his life. How McConaughey reacts to this is absolutely touching and makes the audience care about these characters. The movie has an excellent supporting cast that includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain (as a grown up Murphy), and another A- list celebrity whose name is nowhere in the credits because I assume the filmmakers wanted it to be a surprise. There are also some very interesting robot characters, that have one of the most original designs I've ever seen. The movie is an absolute joyful experience to watch, and provides visuals of space this side of ""Gravity"". In a film where CGI is basically mandatory, Nolan manages to use a little as possible. Apparently he even shot these scenes WITHOUT ANY GREEN SCREENS!!! There are scenes on an ice planet that could have been very convenient to use green screen, yet it was actually filmed on a glacier in Iceland. To top it off Hans Zimmer backs it up with arguably the best score of his career and that's saying something. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is supposed the film that inspired Christopher Nolan and that definitely shows. Although Stanley's Kubrick's film lacks the emotional touch of ""Interstellar"". I would not be surprised if Nolan owes a debt to Andrei Tartovsky's ""Solaris"", a sci-fi epic that deals with the emotional turmoil of the characters while raising questions about humanity. In this review I have left out countless point points and twists, because this movie is more of an experience than a formulaic picture. Unlike Nolan's recent films, this was not released as a summer blockbuster and I can see why. This is perhaps his most thought-provoking film, even more so than ""Inception"". The reason I give this movie a 9/10 instead of a perfect score is that I often felt that there was too much scientific speak in the dialogue, though granted it is delivered well by the actors. However the flaws are really just nitpicks. One final comment is that while for the first 2/3 of the movie I was admiring the visuals, the final act made me lean forward in my seat, with my mouth dropped.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","In a nutshell. If Stanley Kubrick was alive he would go and take all the 2001: A Space Oddisey copies to that same desert where Atari buried all the copies of their ET video game back in the 80's. Exquisite narrative, emotional but contained enough, hypnotic space scenarios, vast imagination to outline how the psyche of a human being would be torpedoed by long-lasting isolation, and above all how a concerned father and someone who can make a difference stands up and delivers his way best. Look, I went to the Theatre at 22:00 pm and I honestly thought I was immediately going to get asleep. It was not the case. On the contrary I stood without batting an eye the entire film. Yes, many would say it is quite an statement to say it is the best film one's ever seen. I've seen many masterpieces The Life of Others, Shawshank Redemption, Amadeus etc etc I'm still convinced Interstellar shines above them all.

I'm amazed with the complexity of the ideas in almost all of his movies, and I think this one is the most complex of all. To do this kind of a movie means that you have a good chance that you will make a potential filmmaking suicide. That is why Interstellar triumphs with flying colors.

24 November 2014,mbk-471-767233,10," A beautiful, classically modernist sci fi movie
","There are so many reviews already on ""Interstellar"" that I will leave it at just my own emotional reaction. In the first half hour or so my heart was sinking because the character and story development are very slow. This is not an action movie. As the main story builds though, the emotional content also builds. In the final analysis, this is a movie about humanity, and maybe more emotional than many a love story or other tearjerker. The second half of the movie is both riveting on the plot level, and emotionally intense. It has something of ""2001 Space Odyssey"", it has something of ""Gravity"", and yet: it is more emotionally complete than ""2001"" and more emotionally real, and relevant, than ""Gravity"". I can see how it may not be for everyone. But it worked for me. And thankfully we are spared many of the tried and true end of the world tropes. No finger wagging here. In fact there is a nod and twinkle to science and against anti-science and romantic back to the roots forces. In its basic premise it is therefore much more modernist - in the space age fashion of the 1950s and 60s - than other current sci fi. Modernist, optimist, yet not triumphalist.

","OMG! WOW JUST WOW! THAT CUT ME DEEP REAL DEEP!. 2 words to describe this movie ""Absolutely Astounding!"". Gets 10 out of 10 in my highest ever scored movie I'll ever make in my entire life or ""Time"" of my life hehe {you'll get what I mean}. This movie was absolutely astounding with how amazing the science, physics and quantum mechanics that was involved in the movie. Probably one of the best space movies I have ever watched. It's beyond it's time, it's beyond imagination of how real you can precisely present space time and relativity and combining it with exploration. Can not believe how amazing this movie was and the freakin music score WOOOW! Hans Zimmer you win every single award you get in next years awards,,,, Just wow. I've had movies do this to me before, but never this deep in cutting me up emotionally at the end. I knew it would get my appraisal but Jesus it was freaking good. I reckon if they presented this movie in the 70's it would probably be the star wars of the era up until today. It's practically this modern days highest praise space movie ever to hit the screen. The visuals were stunning (was in oar) with how the representation of galaxies, black holes and event horizons through space were shown. Absolutely astounded by the script too, very very original and amazing to the other space movies you normally see on screen. So much time and effort put into the dialog which I love in movies like this. Character development was superb and humour top notch hehehehe I particularly love TARS the robot. But back to the music, some critics have been giving this movie crap about the volume. The volume level and intensity in some of the scenes just makes it that one step further in beating your heart on the edge (not spoiling anything but the docking space station scene in catastrophic motion, was awesome to watch intertwine with Han Zimmers pounding score). I saw it in Vmax so the digital sound was loud and perfect in the bass scenes. Actually walked out of the cinema in amaze and grasping at the fact of what I just saw. I'd go as far as saying the storyline and intertwining the ""cough"" kind of far-fetched but border-lining possible ending was just gorgeous. The basic premiss which you try to wrap your head around at the end, it's kind of the same transition of how the Matrix ended practically like wow! that was original and amazing.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

It is a commentary on human nature, an epic journey through space and time that is grounded in reality and backed by solid theory. This is why I imagine a lot of people don't like Interstellar. It's too complicated for the average idiot to understand. This is why it's been called boring. But I assure you, if you have ever looked up at the stars and wondered at our place in the universe, then you will love this movie. As far as I'm concerned, this film doesn't need to be quantified by any rating system. The plot, acting, SFX and sound design are all rendered unimportant by what this film has to say about the humanity. That what truly defines us is our curiosity, our determination to survive no matter what it takes. Our desire to know the unknown and to try and understand our purpose in the universe.

","This story brought forth compelling and interesting concepts- namely the concept of time. The story follows Cooper who is on a mission to find a safe haven, a new planet, for his future generations to live. He constantly is battling against the concept of time: time lost with his children, time away from home, sleeping time away in cryosleep, and the time limit of Earth's atmosphere being livable. Pulling together these struggles against time together into such a fascinating and captivating story really got my attention and retained my attention as well. The film's production blew me away, really. Especially with the time skips, I think that the actors and actor selection for the grown-up versions of characters worked really well. And when any movie takes place in space, they have to really sell it, and I feel they really did in this movie. I remember one specific instance when they first were going into space. They were leaving the atmosphere and as soon as they were into space and floating away from Earth, the music cut and all we heard was subtle breathing if the astronauts and the shifting of the rocket ship. This was great use of silence to really drive home the feeling and impact of being alone and separate from everything that Cooper just left behind at Earth. In reflection, I can't do anything as grand as they did in this film, but I can certainly take certain elements into consideration for my future video projects, such as using the audio to further tell the story as this one did in the aforementioned (and unmentioned) examples in the movie.

There is no antagonist, and in this way this film is the most realistic, for the only thing that most people battle in their lives are the harsh natures of reality rather than a superimposed bad guy. The ending is incredibly emotional and, to me, was quite unexpected. Do not let the run time disturb you, for it only gets more well made and more emotionally captivating as it progresses.

Despite these lofty associations, visual gravitas and meticulous scientific references are not the sole features that made Kubrick's seminal 1968 film a classic – these aspects are also not what solidify Interstellar into the canon of future classics.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I have no intentions of watching this movie not because it's a Nolan film. I enjoyed his Inception and think his movies are much intelligent than most other Hollywood movies which are mostly predictable or cliché in every department. After I watched this thriller, I decided to give it a miss until a new friend insisted I must watch and claimed it is a very special movie, and so I watch it just to see how reliable is my new friend. It's not up to my expectations. OK, the script is intelligent but that can be read from a book. A movie is everything visual and sound. Other than a few nice scenes and overall nice music, there is nothing much else. It doesn't give one the impact and surprise which Kubrick's 2001 did. This movie will not win anything from international film competitions. A score of 7 to 8 is reasonable. My conclusion is it is good by Hollywood standard but 8.9 here ? There isn't enough more room for a better movie then. Do IMDb members tend to rate new movies higher or mostly fanbois here ?

The story has so many different layers from the love between a father and daughter to finding a place for humanity to survive. The acting is well done. Matthew Mcconaughey gives yet another outstanding performance and Anne Hathaway really drives home the emotion of their voyage. The visuals are unbelievable and paired with Hans Zimmer's score, I had goosebumps in nearly every major scene. The science can be a bit daunting for someone who has never dealt with any hard astronomy but the movie does a pretty good job of explaining most of the theories.

The ideas and the plot pose interesting questions. Some of the ideas stretch credulity just a little too far. However a film that makes you think is worth seeing. The photography and special effects are outstanding. However the so-called background music takes over in some places and the dialogue is difficult to hear. Out there in the vastness of space why is it necessary to have such intrusive music? The acting is competent but certainly not Oscar winning standard. McConaughay and Hathaway don't really have to try too hard and McConaughay's mumbling at times is a little annoying. Michael Caine is probably the best actor in the film.

Even with all the action sequences making up over 90 percent of the movie, the underlying conflict between the two main characters keeps audience thriving for more.

I would have given a more fair review on the effects if the plot and story was better. But I am being unfair because in my opinion the story was pretty bad. 2. most of the ratings are based on the oh ah moment near the end during the communication thing between dad and daughter. That was just not enough in my opinion. All the descriptions the director tried to explain during the movie failed failed and then failed again. If they would have shortened the movie to 1.5 hours, It would not have been a little less disappointing.

Someone even said that if you loved 2001, you'd hate this movie. 2001 is one of my favourite movies of all time, but Interstellar is up there, it certainly has more heart than 2001, but really they are different stories with different outcomes. Another reviewer pointed out that the movie ""Contact"" was inspiration for Interstellar. I love Contact. Seeing it on the big screen was stupendous. But Interstellar in IMAX trumped it. I don't know what people want anymore. This film had heart, a great story, good acting, spectacular visuals.... It was complex, at least to me it was, and I have no guilt admitting that. My gift is art, not astro-physics or film making, and looking at this film was pure entertainment and a work of art. The Docking scene... the scene so many people seem to go on and on about, is far and away the most exciting few minutes of cinema I've ever seen. The audience actually clapped at the climax of that scene, and Hans Zimmer's understated but gigantic score really unlined the tension. Of course, some would argue that film music shouldn't do this, that Kubrick used silence, that Hitchcock did this or that. I disagree. What is film music for then? Is it a throwaway thing that should be in the background. I don't think so. It made this scene. It was a wonderful partner to the movie itself.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting was OK but I feel there should be more to science fiction movies than interstellar drag racing or sh-- like Independence Day and ET. Although ET did have a sentimental side which was OK. But the reality of just where the human race is in this mystery of universal creation makes using escapism in SF movies a low blow. That is if you do read and not just get your deeper thoughts from movies and TV. Interstellar had too much in consuming action and not enough in suspense. The way he was caught in a time dimension when coming back was shown in an interesting way but it stayed there too long. Unless your a farmer in the flatland Midwest the sentimental side is wasted.

I always enjoyed reading comments and interested in other people's opinions, but this time I feel I just saw a different movie than everybody.

I hate to be one of those people who criticize just for the sake of it, but I don't understand, I simply don't, how this movie, full of cliches and cheesy remarks, made especially for box office, gets so high marks. First of all, it just doesn't make any sense at all to me. In nearly three hours long (way too long for a movie anyway), every ten minutes characters switch their view, they say they finally know and understand the whole thing, the purpose, the way things are going, just to completely change their mind and view ten minutes after. And this is going on for the whole movie. Second, the cheesy talk and cliches of characters, classic jokes you see in each Hollywood movie, cool guy attitude of Matthew McConaughey, southern ""yee-haws"" that don't fit into a SF movie and, in general, situations that will NEVER arise in real life. I can pause the movie every line of dialogue and question a lot of things about why this and that and not this, because the whole scenario and script doesn't make sense. I am not a total moron, I am a college graduate, I like to believe I understand things, but this movie just doesn't make sense at all to me.

","I haven't even taken off my coat, what I am saying now is fresh of my mind. I HAVE TRULY NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS FILM. Sure, it takes influence from 2001: A Space Odyssey and it has a similar mind bending theme to some of Nolan's previous films like Inception but it really stands itself apart. The writing which at times can go of at a tangent is still superb, a lot of the film is fuelled with scientific theories which may work for some people or may not. If you can get past that crossing reality barrier then you can really see what is great about Interstellar. None the less Nolan doesn't disappoint which came as no surprise, you can really see how hard Nolan has worked to make this great, the mass amount of research he did was clearly worth it. The story for the most side works, I know that a lot of people are going say that its momentum dropped two thirds of the way and I can see why they would think that but like I said if you can get past the wild scientific theories you will enjoy this a lot more. The direction was perfect as always with Nolan, he uses his same vibe and once again it doesn't go wrong. This film is visually impressing but that may not come as a wow factor some people after recently seeing space films such as ""Gravity"" but trust me there are many moment sin this film that are worth seeing especially on the big screen. The performances were outstanding especially Matthew McConaughey who once again deserves an award for this performance, If there was any point in this film where I would lose hope, Matthews performance would bring straight back him, he really delivers powerful performance just like he did in true detective. Obviously Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon and Michal Caine are worth a mention, they performed well but the film was primarily based on Matthews's character throughout so some people may not appreciate the other performances because of his being so amazing. The music and sounds were also very good thanks to Hans Zimmer once again, you can see they take a lot form space odyssey but with their own unique sound. I don't want to say too much because I'm afraid I will ruin this and this is not a film that should be ruined for people. Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself which I dint think he could do again; he has never made a bad film.

The music was also way to loud in parts and drowned out the dialog often. What's with that? Is it because the dialog wasn't achieving its intended dramatic effect - so the music is supposed to?

McConaughey & Mackenzie Foy from ""Twilight"" who plays Lil Muprh are very good. The movies biggest problem is the script. The movie really fails in convincing you that the World is going to end. They just show you 1 little Town and never mention other Countries. Also apart from Cooper and Murph there aren't any other characters to care about. I was a bit of a Hathahater last year when Hathaway was acting all pretentious, smug and saying things like ""I will use my Awards as Weapons against self doubt"". But I looked into those Big Doe eyes and her Pale skin and forgave her. In this She goes from being smart to putting everyone in danger because of stereotypical female emotions. Poor Jessica Chastain had to play a Daddy Issues Monster and look demented into the camera. The space crew is the most disorganised Space crew I have ever seen. Carrie Mathison needed to show up and take charge. The ending is laughable and nonsensical. Nolan needed to stop overthinking everything. With all the plot holes there is no way this is the Smartest movie ever made. ""Her"", ""District 9"" & ""Inception"" were all smarter than this because they were more straight forward with their ideas. Overall it is an entertaining movie and it's impossible to be bored by it.

Interstellar is a sci-fi journey to go beyond what is known in order to save humanity, but it is also a story about human relationships, sacrifices, making difficult choices and most importantly love. The concept that the bond between humans remains intact despite distance, space or time was beautifully portrayed in the film and felt most intensely in every heart-wrenching scene between father and daughter and even between the explorers as they journeyed across space. It tells a story of the survival of humanity weaved with intense emotions and the search of knowledge of the unknown.

","""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt."" Interstellar is the rare film that forces deep consideration of ""our place"" in both the terrestrial and celestial spheres, though its conclusions are perhaps less satisfying than the cinematic journey itself. It's an provocative, enthralling, ambitious movie that comes at a time when space exploration has seen some new horizons.Earth has been rendered useless by an climatic disaster called as the Blight – forcing humanity to abandon earth and in the dreams of discovery, in order to focus on basic survival. To this, former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a widowed father of two, is now a farmer tasked with growing one of the planet's last remaining sustainable crops: corn.Because the earth appears to be on a hopeless trajectory, NASA is actively and secretly developing an escape plan for humanity, but first they must find a livable planet. Thankfully a Dylan Thomas-quoting physicist, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), has discovered a mysterious wormhole near Saturn which provides a shortcut to unexplored galaxies and, potentially, habitable planets. Early expeditions through the wormhole (aptly titled the ""Lazarus"" missions) have not returned and no one knows what they may have discovered. A new mission is necessary, and the survival of the human race depends on it. Cooper, a widower raising a young son and daughter alongside his father-in-law (John Lithgow), makes the tough decision to embark on a journey that might ensure a future for his children but will almost certainly mean he won't see them again for many years, if ever. Deep space travel of this sort does odd things with time, you see. One hour on a distant planet can equal years back on earth. Survival is Interstellar's most central theme. It's no coincidence that the words of Dylan Thomas are repeated throughout: Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Every character in the film is a testimony to the natural instincts of self-preservation and adaption in the face of extinction: doing whatever it takes to survive, both as individuals and as a species; surviving",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting is awful - Matthew M getting buy on plaudits from recent shows - but acting the same part / vocabulary over and over again - c'mon.

","Interstellar is a sci-fi epic that explores the themes of love, sacrifice, and survival in a dying world. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former NASA pilot and engineer who is recruited to lead a mission through a wormhole to find a new home for humanity. Along with his crew, which includes Dr. Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Dr. Romilly (David Gyasi), and Dr. Doyle (Wes Bentley), as well as two robots, TARS (voiced by Bill Irwin) and CASE (voiced by Josh Stewart), Cooper leaves behind his children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom , and his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow), to embark on a journey that will test the limits of science, time, and human nature.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interstellar is not just a film but a historical accomplishment that will forever be remembered. Firstly, director Christopher Nolan has chosen incredible actors. The story is perfect, you don't even realise how long the movie is until you finish it. Secondly, the music. Gracefully played by the remarkable German musician, Hans Zimmer, the interstellar soundtrack left an outstanding addition to the film. The story was beautifully woven together (again I acknowledge Nolan and his crew) when cooper leaves earth-- and his father, son and daughter, his daughter in particular wants him to stay-- to find a new home for the planets inhabitants. He discovers that they were not meant to return to earth but rather start their own colonization on a new planet. Overall, cooper and his accomplices in space travel through wormholes/blackholes and at one point at the end, cooper seems to be doomed to die, he enters the ""5th dimension"". Where seemingly he can communicate with his daughter on earth. In the end he is saved by oher travellers and brought to a space station where he sees his daughter one last time --in space time has traveled slower for cooper then on earth and his daughter is much older than him. But an incredible story with a fascinating plot. I will never forget this film.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is the worst film I've seen since I can't even remember when. First of all, Anne Hathaway is enough to make any film make you question if the casting crew was on acid and makes Sandra Bullock look like a prodigy. At times you also question the evolution theory. OK, this was arguably ad hominem- Anne's speech about love, on the other hand, is taking things to the next level- it was like listening to a 12 yo Kardashian with a mental impairment trying to say something deep. The Galaxy, if anything (although probably equally as dumb) was visually impressive whereas this insult to your mind, vision and pocket was just plain WTF. Initially, I was glad to see that there would be no spectacular outer space battles which made me think that they would focus on the visual and/or scientific. But no. They so painfully failed at both that for the first time ever, even though I never leave the cinema, I just had to abandon the premises. I do understand that it's supposed to be sci-fi but that's the thing- sci-fi is a combination of science and fiction, not of bunch of misguiding cretinism and infinitely boring narrative. It's also amazing how someone can make a great film with Ben Affleck and someone fails to make one with Matthew McConaughey. Dylan Thomas is certainly turning in his grave. Oh, and so very convenient that nobody has aged while Matt Damon was out there- kind of defeats the storyline. Don't get me wrong, I am no stranger to bullshit films and on principle do not detest them, sometimes, even often enjoy them but this was potentially lethal.

A vortex porthole into another dimension, pulling through our undestroyable energy to another realm. We are far and close in what our souls can see in fractals of continuing existence.

","SPOILER Don't READ _ INTERSTELLAR REVIEW. _I have very mixed feeling after seeing Nolan's Interstellar. Yes it was a visually epic film, dealing with death, our existence, love and I think the main plot the theory of relativity. I also was thankful it wasn't preachy about a God being in that equation for the main plot or i would of walked out. So much was going on, and even tho i didn't feel the ""experience"" even more on IMAX, I get it, it was shot on film, although i think it really didn't matter for the average film goer cause first of all, its Nolan, and second with all the production put into this film, he could shot of a DSLR and made it as epic. It was a long movie and at time it thought where is this going and with hints of M Nights Signs, and Kubrick's aesthetic of 2001, yes all the elements to expel an epic tale were happening in real time and it was a great ride. My age is showing just thinking about Dylan Thomas's quote ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" that was in this movies main theme but all i could think of was Rodney Dangerfield Back To School. Kids looks it up. One thing that pulled me out just like in Gravity, is the Clooney affect, too many good looking actors in space. I mean when I saw Matt Damon stuck on another planet, yea I was like, cm on whats next, Ryan Goslin on Mars?.Also, I do like that the idea that love can transcend time and space and ""GRAVITY"" but in this film i felt love was the buffer, love doesn't answer the main question which after watching the film, i was left with. We die, and our existence isn't based on just love, but survival. but then i guess there wouldn't of been a film, just a film of trying saving Earth fighting Aliens again.

9 November 2014,Siloet19,10," Typical Nolan: Movies that transcend your average movie-goer
","I would first like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. After watching the movie a second time, it was even more enjoyable. This movie had your typical Nolan charm, nuanced dialog that features numerous examples of intelligent foreshadowing and providing answers for questions that are brought up later in the movie. There is a prevailing theme that permeates the entire movie, however I actually missed it the first time I saw the movie because of a bathroom break. It was there throughout the entire movie, but like the last piece of the puzzle, it tied everything together. That's the beauty of Nolan's storytelling, there are so many things that can be discarded as useless, while they actually serve a purpose in the story. When I go into a Nolan movie, I don't expect one thing or another, instead, I watch every scene for what it is and wait for the story to develop in front of my eyes. There were many scenes that I felt were a waste as I first watched the movie, but as the story developed, it became abundantly clear that their role was to serve as an element of good story-telling. After seeing the movie the second time, I was able to pick up on a number of things I missed and the movie does a great job or reconciling most of the ""plot holes"" that people seem to be complaining about. Again, like other Nolan movies, this movie is not going to be for everyone. If you prefer everything simplified and laid out for you so that even young children could understand, I recommend more of a children's movie or a comic-book movie. If you prefer a bland, almost non-existent story with great visuals, I would recommend a move like Gravity. If you prefer an intelligent story-line with the use of traditional story-telling techniques like foreshadowing, a central theme that permeates the movie in ways you may not fully understand in the first viewing, and that may require you to pay attention in scenes you have yet to understand, I highly recommend Interstellar. If you are someone that likes to nit-pick movies or believes that they are smarter than the movie they are watching and the story-teller who wrote the movie, I would stay away. Chances are you are going to miss key elements of the movie because you won't be viewing the movie for what it is. I have noticed that most of the negative critiques complaining about plot holes actually missed portions of the movies that reconcile those ""so-called"" plot holes. With all that said, an easy 10/10 and a must see at least twice on IMAX.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Firstly, this is a science fiction movie which shows imaginary happenings of theories, hypothesis and equations derived in astro physics. It would slightly disappoint audiences expecting an interesting science story, entertaining/action sequences; heavily disappoint audiences having no knowledge of scientific/astro physic terms. Story starts from nowhere, (no year mentioned) and slowly you will come to know it is happening sometime in future, after hearing discussions about Apollo mission and Russian Bankruptcy. It goes very vague as if the initial scenes/happenings (ghost) has no connection at all with core idea. Then the story (I can say sequence, not story) takes turn as a typical space travel movie. You could appreciate only the feel of IMAX experience which is awesome in this movie. Matt Damon is a useless element (you might get excited after seeing him in the movie, but don't expect the expectations). The imaginary visuals of worm hole, black holes and planet Saturn were eye catching and something to appreciate the graphics/ special effects team. Excellent CGI. The model of spaceship and other elements were also good. Here comes the concept of time dilation (when there is dense gravity) which made the duration of 1 hour equal to 7 earth years. Reaching planet Saturn quickly through a worm hole. Introduction of 5th dimension in space-time and communicating to the past from future gives meaning to the opening scenes. Now you will get the connect after watching the movie for nearly 2 hrs 15 mins. The emotional elements included were good. The last 30 mins of the movie would make you feel like you are in a different world, especially when you are surrounded by unknown substances and could live in a 5th dimension. Science fiction makes time travel possible. Father meeting his daughter after she looks like his great grand mother is really nice segment.

Its genius like Christopher Nolan who stretch the ability to think on a public level.There have been many other good sci fic movies but interstellar is the best i have seen so far.

This movie is visually stunning, almost to epic proportions. The worlds they visit are very simplistic and straightforward, but it looks amazing and these worlds are full of suspense. The camera work melds perfectly with the danger at hand while the music ices the cake. The performances were impeccable, obviously McConaughey completely steals the show. So much emotion is put into his role as a father figure and one scene even went so much as to make me tear up. It got to a point where you saw yourself in his situation torn between a greater task and your own flesh and blood. Then after the conclusion of the movies climax action this film somewhat disappears up its own ass. It gets very convoluted very quickly but the rest of the film is so good that you have to take it with a grain of salt. Easily would be a masterpiece if it didn't shoot itself in the foot, but regardless it is a great film.

At that point, it became strange and I really wasn't understanding how they came up with the conclusion as they did. All in all, the first 140 minutes were great... It's the last 20ish minutes that really ruined the movie for me. It just seemed really improvised like they didn't quite know how to end it so they just made some stuff up. I will say that the best part of the movie was the visuals as they are stunning. However, as past movies have taught us, a movie needs to be more than visuals with part of a sensible story.

This is exactly how you feel. You feel like you've come back from space when the credits begin to roll. The movie is 3 hours of never ending awe inspiring twists and turns, making you feel every emotion possible all in one movie (along with a lot of Mind F***ing). Matthew McConaughey is a heart warming character that you root for the entire film. The movie is perfectly acted. Though I wont be surprised if it doesn't win an awards for its acting (It's no Heath Ledger Joker acting, but what is?), it's plot, characters and special effects are what makes you love the movie.

1 July 2016,IanRayonline,10," Stunning insight Into The Future - A Masterpiece With A Few Irritating Flaws
","Very appropriately, there are some wonderful nods here to Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's groundbreaking 1968 film, ""2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY"". ""INTERSTELLAR"" is truly the next chapter in the exploration of the future begun by that movie and it parallels ""2001"" its use of powerful metaphorical imagery along with meaningful technical content. I heard so much about this film being vetted by the top physicists that I actually expected it to have its science fully together. So let's begin with a basic correction: ""Time"" is NOT the ""4th dimension""; the ""4th dimension"" is NOT ""Time"". Time has been clearly perceived from the emergence of conscious living beings - no one was aware of the 4th dimension until Einstein proposed its existence in the 1920s. To be clear, our sense of time is a direct result of our universal, unidirectional passage through that elusive 4th dimension. But time is merely a subjective artifact - one clearly perceivable to beings that can only directly perceive 3 dimensions. So, okay - in a movie so deeply concerned with the 4th dimension, would it have been so hard to take a moment to finally clear up that blurred distinction? Another scientific slip: the dialogue presents the creatures that experience a 5-dimensional existence as if they somehow possess the 5th dimension. No - they don't have a dimension that applies only to them. That 5th dimension, like all dimensions, should be presented as universal and ever-present. They, unlike ourselves, simply are able to perceive and presumably to operate in it. Aargh! How long are we going to have to wait for a another film like ""2001"" that really is written with a full understanding of how the space-time continuum really operates? I also have a more mundane complaint. There is a vast difference between a ""great pilot"" and a ""mission commander"". I would have replaced the opening scenes with some actual precision flying AND a demonstration of decisive thinking and outstanding leadership ability. All the agricultural exposition could have been accomplished with a bit of dialogue and/or some on-screen text of some kind. But the film really shifts into high gear with the arrival on other planets. You really FEEL the remoteness and novelty of the other worlds. ""INTERSTELLAR"" probes the supremely critical question of the future of humanity: Are humans capable of facing the daunting challenges of making our move out into the universe? The movie does an extraordinary job of taking on this colossal question, going much farther than any other work that I know of. And for me, the movie makes the actual answer supremely clear: ""Absolutely not."" I'm not sure that's really a spoiler because, though there may be one character in the film who agrees with me on this, it's not quite the conclusion of the movie itself. Some of the dialogue on this subject is so far beyond brilliant that I can't begin to express how deeply it struck me.

","Interstellar takes Einstein's theory of relativity and the story of the man on a train and makes sense of the time related logistical problems of long distance time travel. Man takes off with 14 year old child and returns to a child now facing old age. On the way home the man travels through a black hole. Aside from the fact that everyone pretty much agrees that one would be crushed instantly on entering a black hole, theories about what time might be like in a black hole are portrayed in an interesting and plausible fashion. Kudos of the first degree for everyone involved. If you want to understand the theory of relativity and its impact on time, watch this movie. On earth, the science is a bit more questionable. Earth has entered some sort of cataclysm with lots and lots of people dead, and coming out of it, government ended war, and people are not employed in the making of food. The making of food is endangered by a series of crop diseases. First, historically, governments have poor record of making fixing things and eliminating war after end of world scale disasters. The plague had more to do with starting the thirty years war, it didn't make it shorter. Then with most of the planet now gone, the remainder is working on making food. The hero of the story is a farmer with 5 automated tractors farming an enormous farm. If one guy is running one ginormous farm with lots of drone tractors, where is the requirement for most of the population to be farmers? And if there are fewer people, there is lower pressure on the earth to produce food. But somehow the ability to produce food crashes. Again, going back to the plague in England, in the aftermath, the English ate beef. Yup, beef. There weren't enough pesants to grow wheat, so the land went fallow, and land owners ran cattle. And everyone ate beef. So much so that the English became known as beefeaters (as in the gin).

","Interstellar is a complicated but brilliant journey of Cooper and his team as they travel through space to find a future for mankind in place of residence and survival. Now believe me, i'm a hard critic, and i haven't given out a perfect score as yet, and when reading other reviews i see a mixture of people who liked/loved it and people that found it garbage or disappointing. Upon reading these reviews i found a common trend with the reviewers that didn't like the film, that being that they believed that it was too long, didn't make sense and was boring. However, when viewing the film myself, i have to respectfully disagree with the reviewers who didn't like the film, and here is why. For people who didn't understand the film because it didn't make sense to them, that should make it a bad film, plus upon viewing the film, everything is pretty much explained if you pay attention, and most people watching this film most likely went into it with a negative attitude to not see what really occurred in the film. This is the main factor in why people didn't understand the film as they bring a negative attitude into watching the film and do not follow the story as they just want the film to finish. Of course there are flaws i found with the film, with it being a tad long yes and the fact that the film had the potential to masterpiece and to aim for the sky, but it really only landed in the stars. Nonetheless, the film is wonderful and i fully encourage people to watch it, with good emotional experiences for the characters which are well performed (most of the time) and a story which really sours into the night. Also for anyone who believes there a scientific inaccuracies in the film, please do remember this is in the future where technology and science would of come along way from our present time. This is a good film",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
30 March 2015,friscolver,1," Movie could have been much, much better
","Too complex to understand, McConaughey incomprehensible, too many unanswered questions. The script - storyline blew it on all fronts. Here's the way I wished it would have played out. Establish better setting & foundation. World's climate is changing for the worse, in haste and a means to provide hope, vast amounts of new money is granted into the world space program to investigate and explore an unknown anomaly (worm hole) found near Saturn. The first group of scientists penetrated it a few years back, disappeared from contact but somehow sent a successful radio signal back to Earth indicating they found something magnificent which would be considered one of the greatest discoveries of all mankind. Send in the next group of scientists (better equipped and better technology) to find out more about what happened to the first group. (You could have built an entire movie around that worm-hole by itself.) As they come alongside the worm hole, conduct tests, send in probes, then eventually manned spacecraft. Once inside the worm-hole magically transports to another galaxy and in close proximity of a solar system similar to ours of which there are planets that can sustain life. They find a planet there like Earth. Alien beings (smart and intelligent) welcome them to their planet. They find their comrades there in good health and well being. They exchange technologies and are told that a whole plethora of wormholes are all over the place in space but they need to be ""opened"" by some sort of gravity means. The aliens have perfected this. The aliens learn about the slow demise of Earth's atmosphere, they offer assistance. A few of them go with the scientists back to Earth and all is saved!! See? Now THAT would have been a better story than the Interstellar movie script.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
27 November 2014,jatinneversaydie,10," Just watched it the 3rd time...its haunting me....
","what to say where to start from this movie is an absolute epic..A beautiful SAGA that will live forever in the history of movie making..our future generations will be jealous of us cause we were lucky enough to watch it in our lifetimes.. Nolan is just getting better and better..There is no end to his perfection. with every movie we feel like he has achieved perfection but next time he amazes us by achieving even more than what he has done previously.. He is just raising his bar each time.only 44 years of age & he has already given us many gems, don't know how many epics he will direct by the time he'l be 70. What makes me respect him more is his serious dedication to cinema & to his fans ,he took 10 years to complete INCEPTION's story and for this he hired KIP Thorne( American theoretical physicist, known for his contributions in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to assist him and advise him in the movie. Nothing shown in the movie is baseless though he has used his imagination very well. Im really amazed why this movie has got few negative reviews also as i coudnt find a single loop hole in it,guess people could not digest so much science..i feel sorry for them that they cant appreciate it. In terms of acting Academy award winner Mathew mcconaughey has delivered a powerful performance,he makes u emotional in some sequences & in others makes you laugh with his good comic timing.he could well be getting a nomination again this year. Nolan's favorite michael caine is as usual sublime .then Jessica chastain and Anne hathaway have also suitably done there jobs. Mackenzie foy who plays young murph's (Mathew mcconaughey's daughter) role has given a mature performance.she's really good in the movie. Not to forget Han Zimmer has a big big hand in making this movie such a phenomena with his music.It is due to his exhilarating music that you latch yourself with this movie.it really keeps haunting you hours after you leave the hall.Nolan has got himself a creative and a legendary musician on his back. Its time for him to win another academy after the lion king. i waited for this movie as soon as it was announced cause i had trust on nolan and he has kept it alive.though difficult but i hope he wins an academy this time cause he truly deserves after so many years of efforts in direction. wake up academy he's knocking at the door...;) cant wait for another one ... love you nolan and zimmer :*",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","i am lucky enough to witness the movie on the first day screening that too in imax.already there was high pitched expectations on the movie as the director was known for his mind bending filmmaking and he succeeded the expectations.some say its an overrated film(which is not).but we have to give it to the man for his taking,story,directioning. he used the worm holes and black holes in a great matter in his storytelling no director had tried before.by taking us into the plot he never failed to entertain us.this is not a routine space exploitation film.i can guarantee that the people who loved prestige and inception are not gonna be disappointed by this film.but yet it is highly unlikely that we can understand the plot when cooper enters the black hole for first time watchers but when you get the plot you can understand where the director is going with his threads of story.interstellar is a film where we can see a mind intriguing plot as well as a good heart warming drama between the daughter and dad.to fully enjoy the movie you must either let go the logic fully(where the director didn't miss) or to understand the logic truly because the movie deals with time travel,black holes,dimensions(4th and 5th),space etc.as to speak of visuals as normal nolan excels in it and the docking scene is one of the best scenes in 2015 and in nolans career so far.as per actors performance each and every actor does a great job but cassey afflects character is bit short and not digged as per my opinion.characterization of each and every character is greatly portrayed(especially manns).music composed by hans zimmer gives soul to the scenes especially where cooper witness and cries by watching years of stocked messages from his family.the film may disappoint some of the directors fans who are expecting another inception or some general audience who did not paid money or time for some not fully entertaining and mind tricking movie which is not understood at first.but for others it is a great movie this year which cannot be missed.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interstellar is a movie which makes you to think the future and ponder about the vast possibility of space travel. But more than that it makes you wonder what a genius Christopher Nolan is. I have the opportunity to watch Interstellar in IMAX and I am amazed. Forget about acting, visual effects, creativity, cinematography - the storytelling is so good that you will get immersed in the experience for the whole time the movie runs. And all the things I have told you to forget about, eventually will grab your attention after coming out of the theater. All the things fits so nicely that there is no scope for complain, no wanting more. I think this is the first movie where the actual black hole (how a star is crushed by gravity), traveling in a wormhole and idea of going beyond the horizon is depicted. Watching all these scenes will leave you awestruck, same goes for the human emotions showed in the movie. The music greatly compliments every scene. Nolan has the habit of working with the same people again and again (Michael Caine the most prominent one), and this movie is not so different. Lots of artists who appear in the previous works of Nolan have done crucial roles very efficiently. ",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This movie has every element of a masterpiece. I can't find a single problem with Interstellar. As a child, I was fascinated by the stars and the cosmos in general. Interstellar took me back to those days when as a kid I was wondering what's going on up there. The plot of the movie is in near future, in a time when the earth can no longer grow seeds, and what are humans without food? They are going to starve! They need a new planet for surviving. Unlike many other Sci-Fi movies, Nolan didn't try to give a futuristic theme to his movie and rightly so. There are no Neon lights here! The story is about a pilot named ""Cooper"" brilliantly played by Matthew McConaughey who was once a pilot for NASA. But since the economy is down, NASA has shut down its operations and he craves for the time when he could still fly. Due to some gravitational anomalies, he somehow manages to find the secret location for NASA because they are still active secretly. As the movie continue, he is employed by NASA once again and with a team of scientists, they fly towards the Saturn where there is a wormhole and it's a gateway to another galaxy. Cooper has to left behind his family and especially his daughter whom he is very attached to. It's a heartbreaking scene when he leaves his house and starts his journey. In the foreign galaxy, there are three possible planets that may support the human life. They visit each one of them and a lot happens in between. Some of the crew members die and it's not a surprise because that is not a normal journey. At the end of the movie, we see human kind survived, but they are not on earth anymore. There are a lot of memorable scenes, like when their ship is passing by Saturn or when they enter the wormhole. The scene where Cooper sees 23 years of videos of his family from earth made me cry, and I'm not an emotional person. How must it feels to know you have lost 23 years of your children's lives for almost nothing? Hans Zimmer's music is one of a kind, and do not disappoint as always. It adds to the wonder and awe of the viewer about the amazing cosmos. Christopher Nolan deserves a standing ovation for this work of ultimate art. This is the first time that I have reached double digits for watching a movie. I have watched Interstellar 10 times and every time I enjoyed for the whole 2 hours and 49 minutes. It's safe to stay that Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time and the first movie that I am writing a review for it on IMDb. The whole cast and crew did an amazing job.

","Good movie that draws you in immediately and keeps you interested. I really enjoyed it. Without seeing any previews of the movie it was thoroughly captivating and emotional all the way. Not sure if these are spoilers but I liked how ""Love"" transcends everything. And although the movie is epic and thoughtful like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", some of the effects also reminded me of ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"". The first docking scene has pulsating music that reminded me of the probe sound in 2010 when it's surveying Europa and it discovers chlorophyll; and also the ""aerobraking"" maneuver. In addition, I agree with Christopher Nolan not liking a 3D format. I saw ""Interstellar"" in an older theater on a screen that is small compared to today's screen sizes and I don't think I missed any experience whatsoever.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

27 February 2020,cooper-station,10," The greatest sci-fi film/The greatest film!
","There are a lot of film titles you will hear when discussing the greatest sci-fi film of all time, A space Odyssey, Alien, The Empire Strikes Back, Blade Runner, The Matrix. Don't get me wrong, all are worthy titles and a strong argument can be made for each. One film you may not hear is Interstellar. As a fan from day one, and when I say day one, I do mean day one, as in the day Christopher Nolan announced his next project was a time travel film, it still dumbfounds me, and I will never understand why. Maybe it will be one of those films that is remembered more fondly as time progresses, maybe on the 10 or 20 year anniversary the film will find itself on more top ten lists, dare I say maybe at the top of a few. Don't get me wrong, the film was a hit. It grossed north of 600 million and recieved universal acclaim upon its release. Despite that, this film is criminally underrated.
As I stated earlier, I was on this film from day one. Being a huge Nolan fan, as soon as the announcement came, I was unbelievably excited. I couldn't wait for the release. When I saw the teaser one year prior to the release, I didn't think I could wait that long.
There were other films around this time that I was incredibly excited for. One was Man of Steel. When I left the theater from seeing that film, I was completely shocked at how bad it was. Growing up with Jim Carrey, I was also pumped for the Dumb and Dumber sequel. I won't even get into the depressed feeling I felt walking out of that theater. For this film however, I was more excited for than the other two combined. I remember walking into the theater, I began to become nervous that the film wouldn't live up to the extraordinary hype that I had built up for it in my head, seeing as how the other two hadn't. When I walked out of the theater, it took 20 minutes for my jaw to close. It not only met my expectation, it surpassed it. Nothing could have prepared me for the emotional roller coaster that was this film. The visuals were out of this world, literally and figuratively. The first movie that I saw and knew that the CGI would not age. The story was unbelievable. The classic story of the ordinary man thrown into the extraordinary situation. I didn't cry, but I easily could have. Everything that the actors feel, you feel. The performance from Matthew and Hathaway were spectacular. And that ending, WOW!
The fact that this film was not even nominated for best picture that year was the moment that for me confirmed that the oscars are completely useless. Not that this film needs any Oscar for validation. It is spectacular and magnificent in every way, and is not a film you will soon forget after viewing. It will make you think, make you cry, make you laugh, and make you wonder what the academy considers a great film. This review section was the first thing that had anything to do with this film outside the film that made any sense to me. When I read all of the rotten tomatoes reviews and reviews from a few other web sites I started to question whether they had left their thoughts on the wrong page, Thankfully on the IMDB user page, everything made sense again. I thought to myself, there are still people with brains and taste for cinema left in this world.
I won't spoil any part of this film because that would be robbing someone of something that won't come around again for a long time. If you haven't seen the film, just watch it. Don't read any more reviews, JUST.....WATCH.......IT",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","There are many great reviews on this website for this great movie. However, I will not talk about the space/time/gravity and all that jazz.

The gut wrenching heartaches and the moments of the characters being human not characters is what really got me. Mathew McAlright gave the most mesmerizing performance of his career in my opinion. The man hit the nail with his character. The rest of the cast including Anne Hathway and Jessica Chastain were nothing short of spectacular with their character portrayals as well. Sure, the story was unique and had an amazing back drop, but the humanity of these characters in crucial moments in their lives is extraordinary. Christopher Nolan scars you with this story about humanity and its survival instincts, the lengths that it will go to preserve what we call special, life.

At the beginning, it starts of a little bit slow, but it kind of builds up the world and the life on Earth during the blight. This build certainly pays off, when McConaughey and Hathaway embark on a journey that changes the game for science fiction thrillers forever. Once they go into space, the movie kicks into high gear, and never slows down until the very end. The way Nolan jumps back in between earth and space is unmatched, and the creative plot even gives Inception a run for its money. The ending portion of the film was shocking and immersed you into this world. Nolan crafts the film and tinkers with topics that no one has ever dared to go into before.

","The two keywords of this movie are time and space. Time first, or rather the motive for what happens in the film, because the Earth is dying, and you have to move to find a new home;because due to the relativity of time, it is necessary to move during expeditions, otherwise the hours pass for the astronauts, but on earth the years;because life goes on without even realizing it. Then comes space, another founding base of the film, in which NASA manages to find a way to create a new civilization by finding a new life in another galaxy. That said, the film's three main protagonists are Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), Amelia Brand (Anne Hathaway), Murphy (Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain),which will be surrounded by other characters such as Professor Brand (Michael Caine), Tom (Timothée Chalamet and Casey Affleck), Romilly (David Gyasi), Dr. Mann (Matt Damon) ... definitely a high-level cast. It all begins with a gravitational anomaly, which will lead Cooper and Murphy to really discover the fate of the earth. Cooper, while consuming his daughter's heart, will go on a mission, which includes arriving in a whoremole near Saturn, which will take the astronauts first to a very hostile planet, with anomalous waves, and then to the planet of Dr. Mann which he will betray Cooper and Amelia. Everything will be resolved in the Gargantua black hole, where Cooper will discover time in a physical dimension, and through the hole he will help his daughter to save the population on earth. The film is very emotional in some moments, such as Cooper's viewing of the children's messages, and the film has a great script and direction, both handled by Christopher Nolan. Particular attention was paid to the scientific part, with references to physics and astronomy. Also incredible are the soundtracks edited by Hans Zimmer, who probably deserved the Oscar in 2015.

23 December 2016,lawyer24,10," Finally writing a review of one of my favorite movies of all time
","I don't write enough reviews. I've seen a lot of movies and contributed to a lot of message boards but I have not written many reviews. Time to get caught up. So let's get right to it. Interstellar may be my favorite movie of all time. When I saw the trailer for this film for the first time, I knew this was a movie I needed to see. My wife, who hates science fiction, watched the trailer with me and she said that this is a movie I must see. Then the reviews started rolling in and they got me excited. Too excited. There are only a few movies I can think of that I was this excited about going in and left even happier - Gladiator, The Avengers and Interstellar. The Story Interstellar blew me away. Point. Blank. Period. I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And I watch it all the way through each time. Let me just say, I did not expect such a heart wrenching story wrapped up in a science fiction space exploration movie. Matthew McConaughey plays the lead character, Joe Cooper (Coop) and does a phenomenal job. Coops daughter, Murph is played by Mackenzie Foy and eventually Jessica Chastain as grown up Murph and then Ellen Burstyn as old Murph. The story starts off slowly but importantly. In the first third of the movie the writers are giving us the background of Coop's relationship with his daughter Murph. And this build up was brilliantly done. The actress playing young Murph did a fantastic job showing the emotion of a young daddy's girl. The chemistry between Coop and Murph was one that any good father to a daughter can relate and that's where it hit home for me. Young Murph loves her father and looks up to him. But she also is not afraid to disobey her father as she possesses his same stubbornness and curiosity. Again, their interaction in the first part is key to build the entire movie. The second third of the film starts when Coop decides he must go on the space exploration mission and leave his family behind for at least a couple of years. Young Murph nailed it here and Grown up Murph finished off where she started. If you are a father and you didn't get watery eyes when Coop left his kids then you are not a human. This part continues on to show the effects of time dilation (a real scientific theory) and the film does a brilliant job of showing the emotional aspect of this phenomenon. The third part deals with sacrifice and ultimately a father doing whatever he could to make good on his promise to his daughter. The Visuals With big budget science fiction the visuals rarely disappoint and there was no exception here. The planets, the spacecraft all were visually stunning. The Soundtrack/Score OMG! You cannot tell a story the way you want to tell a story without a great score and this is where I think Interstellar really nailed it. That's all I can say. The score was amazing and really did a job making those chill bumps appear on your arm.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Locus of control is the degree to which a person believes he controls his own fate and well, Interstellar has shown deeply how fate is predetermined, believing our choices are already drawn up there in a similar world where time is so much different from that we comprehend.

Early on, during the first half of the movie, way too much needless, boring, dialogue, much of which is unintelligible because McConaughey whispers and mumbles for some reason. Anne Hathaway is a horrible casting choice in this type of movie, very unbelievable in this role and should stick with playing musicals. The TARs Robot voice sounded like some guy speaking into a tin can and its monolithic design was ridiculous. The movie leads to some very improbable, leap of faith, bullshit theory of spiritual, space-time that I left me wanting to forget I paid to see this movie and go rent 2001 a Space Odyssey.

","People that will complain about this movie, or call it ''boring'' and give it under 5 ratings simply didn't understand it, neither did they actually pay attention and this is possibly simply not a movie for their taste or them in general ( considering this is a science fiction movie ). Everything about Interstellar makes you question, how much do we actually know about space? What is possible and what isn't? I believe this movie has very small plot holes, nothing unforgivable, also visual effects are done very well, my only complain is that space and those other planets could have been different maybe more imagination put into it, waves and clouds looking way too, may I say basic? Well, since we don't know what is out there, specially so far away, Nolan could have used more imagination, but whatever, Saturn as well wasn't shot well, I felt like it was a Windows background that they used, however everything else was done brilliantly! The books scene at the end gives a lot of ''Inception'' feelings, plot is well done and many plot twists turned out better than I expected them to. I think the movie lives up to it's hype, I am glad it wasn't too much like ''Avatar'' even though I loved it, I hoped for a better plot, which Interstellar has.

That's why it is such a shame that the script fails to carry this incredible high through all the way to the end. Specifically when launched into the final act of the film, the previously superb storytelling gives away to unnecessary exposition. Instead of entrusting the audience with the task to ponder the ending and make up their own mind about what really happened (which would have benefited the movie greatly), Nolan introduces a forced cheesy plot-element that even contradicts the scientific realism displayed earlier in the movie.

There is no doubt behind the effort put in representing the wormhole or the Gargantua or the sequence of the spacecraft traveling through the cosmos, but it was not supported with good acting and strong science fiction script (even fiction can have nice theories made into beautiful script). Some of the scenes were laughable (like ""that will work"" - about the so called novel white-board plan by Cooper or Cooper saying ""Love is quantifiable"" or smth like that) The attempt at philosophy , human values or thought, was at the best mediocre.

","Some movies are really events that must be seen in the format they were created for (Avatar is the best comparison I can make). If you can, I would highly suggest seeing Interstellar on an IMAX screen. If there was only one movie you were going to see at the movie theater this year, this would be the one I'd suggest going to. Do not go expecting an action or comedy flick. This movie was intense and emotionally moving, but felt more deliberate and ""heavy"" than I originally expected. There was little to laugh about, but that didn't stop the movie from grabbing hold of you and making you love it. The visuals are some of the most potent I've ever experienced in a movie. It's fair to make the comparisons to Gravity and 2001, but Interstellar owns it's own place alongside those greats. Without giving anything away, I will just say that some of the use of imagery to explain phenomena that we can barely comprehend was so vividly explanatory that it belonged in a graduate level physics classroom as much as any theater. And you always felt like you were right there with the actors. It was an incredible (and incredibly exhausting) ride. Hans Zimmer does an amazing job scoring the film. No massive overtures to remember or make ringtones from, but everything fits together like a glove. As much as this movie is about man reaching beyond the confines of Earth, it's equally (and possibly even more so) about the relationship of a man and his daughter, and a father's love that connects them beyond space and time. The acting is superb and each actor owns their roles, but it does feel a little cold. The double themed movie is constantly pulling you in opposite directions (I believe intentionally) and it doesn't leave much space for deeper character understanding. Interstellar has incredible action, epic visuals, heart string pulling drama and of course the mind-bending plot points that you should now expect from Nolan, but gives it all to you in a package you're not quite sure you're ready to accept. You will question whether it's possible. And that to me (after having to sleep on it...) is it's brilliance.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

What i didn't understand is when i watched movie i've checked ratings on IMDb and they was quite realistic with score 8+ What i didn't understand is how someone can give score of 1 to movie like this.I mean this is far more better than movies like Legion whos insulting your IQ.Even couple time scientist says in movie that this or that would be possible because we probably have four or five dimension which we cant be part of in our 3D world but there is no way that other life form can exist in a such multydimensional world.The fact is everything in this movie is based on real science and real scientists and astrophysicists(producers)who explained that there easily could be dimension where thought and matter can coexist.Im saying that because in last scenes in movie when Cooper come back from wormwhole hes stucked in new dimenzion where he can see our(room and his daughter)but hes in multydimensional dimension that is not stricted with time in place as ours. So all what this movie expects from you is to have some average IQ to understand story and so you can fully enjoy it.If you are not able to understand what i wrote then this movie is not for you and you should go and watch Legion or something(sarcastic).

","I'd like to start out by saying that this is the first time I have ever written a review for any film, in fact I created an account on IMDb just so that I would be able to review this wonderful work of art. I have been a fan of Christopher Nolan's for quite some time now and have found him to be very inspiring, he has inspired me to pursue a career in film. The way he makes movies is unlike any other director in the business. His goal is to fully immerse the audience into the story and the film its self. He succeeds with Interstellar! Nolan's films are nothing short of spectacular, with titles including Memento, The Dark Knight, Inception, etc. he has never made a bad film in my opinion. Up until about 5 hours ago when I still had not seen Interstellar, The Dark Knight was my favorite movie from Nolan, that has now obviously been changed. When sitting down and waiting for the movie to start I knew that I was going to be in for something good, but I did not realize how good the film was actually going to be. For the full extent of the 2 hours and 49 minute running time of Interstellar, I was at awe. The story was captivating, the visuals were breath taking, and the acting was top notch. I can't remember the last time that I have been so involved with the story and the outcome of a film. The film went through periods where it was very intense, very sad, and very joyful. And once again like Nolan likes to do, (i.e. The Prestige, Memento, Inception) this film with blow your mind. The acting in this film could not have been better, McConaughey delivers one of his best roles to date, and should be up for an Oscar in my opinion. The acting from Michael Caine is nothing short of amazing (if you thought it was sad when he began to cry in TDKR, just wait). Jessica Chastain, and Anne Hathaway were perfect for their roles. It was quite the pleasure watching all of these actors deliver such powerful performances to such a powerful story so perfectly. As is the same for many of Nolan's films the music in this film became a character in itself. Hans Zimmer delivers such a powerful and moving score, he continues to amaze me. His music paired with Nolan's films never falls short of perfection. If you are looking for a film that will leave a lasting impression on you than Interstellar is for you. There have been a lot of 'eh' movies released lately, but I never stop searching to find that perfect movie, that diamond in the rough...this is that movie!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The visuals for the rendering of black holes and giant tidal waves and wormholes use minimal CGI and maximum practical effects making the audience have the best cinematic experience! The score by Hans Zimmer is by-far his best composition ever!It pumps you up in every thrilling moment and makes you weep at silent-toned emotional moments and also connects oneself with the eternal! Deep down,it also is about a father-daughter love story and beautifully explores the concepts of time-dilation,living in isolation and relationships between the alive and the dead via scientific perspective explained for understanding of the common audience too! Overall,the movie is a thrill-ride on cinema-scale as an hour and 6 minutes of it was shot on IMAX film!The movie is so-far Nolan's most ambitious project and dwells into the hearts of its audience!!!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

5 November 2015,jilliphish,10," A completely captivating and inspiring science fiction unlike any other
","In one of the most captivating films of 2014, Christopher Nolan produces a stunning masterpiece of science, cinematography, musical scores, and unanswered questions. Space is our final frontier, being largely unexplored and incomprehensible for most. Nolan daringly tackles this subject like none before; the science in Interstellar is on an entirely new level of complexity as opposed to the usual science-fiction film. Over the course of three gripping hours, viewers are transported into the future of our world: blight has completely wiped out vegetation, save for corn, and caused the Earth to be covered in dust. The main characters in the film assist the somehow still existing NASA by leaving Earth, entering a wormhole, and arriving in a distant solar system orbiting a super massive black hole, hoping to find a planet that is habitable. Because of Einstein's theory of relativity, the astronauts experience time differently than back on Earth, which is just one of their never ending list of problems to overcome. Though the movie is very science-dense and the characters don't usually stop to try to explain what is happening, as would be expected in a usual science-fiction film, the three hours of Interstellar have got to be the most entertaining, most heart-wrenching, most fascinating, most awe-inspiring hours spent in a movie theater. The movie takes viewers into an entirely different world that is far different from ours today, but humanness has not changed. The actors in the film demonstrate, undeniably, the universal and timeless expression of the pain of losing the ones you love and having to abandon everything you've ever known. The emotions the characters must be feeling are portrayed so well; the expressions of absolutely heartbreak and fear can be clearly seen on their faces, and the musical score behind it all, brilliantly composed by Hans Zimmer, adds an incredible effect that leaves viewers feeling everything the characters feel. Many would argue that, as a science-fiction film, there should not an emphasis on emotions and love, but, as the characters discuss, what would be the purpose of anything they do without love, not just for their families and significant others, but for humanity as a whole? It is within reason and justification to include such discussion because, without it, the film would just not be an accurate representation of the human experience, in space or on Earth. Once the movie is over, the audience is left with so many more questions than answers, and not just about the science in the movie. Without giving away details, the ending calls for viewers to walk away and deeply process what they just saw. This is what makes the film so great- it starts a conversation. Should we stop genetically modifying crops to avoid a blight? How possible are the events in the movie? What is relativity, and what really is time? More than anything, this movie is exciting because it inspires people to explore science and mathematics.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

24 November 2014,baenad,6," Talent not in doubt: originality is
","I understand we can't always live in the past, and that just because something is prior doesn't make it better. But sometimes, and more often than not, we are better off with originals, especially if the main thing the spiritual successor succeeds in doing, whether it be ode, sequel, or reboot, is reminding us of where almost all of its ideas came from in the first place. My main problem with 'Interstellar' is that this film tried way too hard to quote and one-up '2001.' It tried way to hard to be ""2001"" for a new generation. I understand that Nolan probably has both genuine love for Kubrick's film and serious philosophical issues with it that he wanted to address. He also probably felt that, at this stage in his career, he's an important, talented, and respected enough director to take on the challenge of making just that: '2001' for a new generation. Nolan is really talented, no question. But he takes from '2001' (and other films like 'Contact') at nearly every moment in this film. You will forgive me if this review seems more like a comparison of two movies than a detailed deconstruction of the movie at hand, but maybe that's because the movie at hand never once stops comparing itself to its primary predecessor. It seems almost insecure in the amount of borrowed material... United States fights for place on Earth among rival superpowers: check. AI's with nearly human personalities brought along with human crew: check. Sociopathic crew-member who prioritizes self-preservation and ""the mission"" above the lives of others: check. ""Born again"" savior figure: check. Adam/Eve metaphors: check. Drawn-out scene of a ship docking with a spinning object: check. Space waltz: check. Orchestral music that overwhelms audience with sound to provoke feelings of intense awe: check- but whereas Kubrick strategically builds crescendos, diminuendos and cadences, both visually as well as with sound, Nolan seems to have two volume settings- loud and really f***ing loud. What's more, many of these ""homages"" didn't even feel like outright plagiarism. They felt like revisions that were half-baked and ultimately irrelevant. HAL 9000 managed to scare us, provoke us, make us question our humanity more than Dr. Mann (Damon), TARS, and CASE combined, all while speaking a fraction of the lines and fulfilling essentially the same narrative purpose as all three combined. The physics is cool, and the script goes to some length to try to explain the scientific principles underlying the film in layman's terms. I get that Nolan probably didn't want to leave things as open-ended or purposefully confusing as Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick. But sometimes in sci-fi you sacrifice explanations of fourth and fifth dimensions (which no one short of a physics PhD would really come close to understanding anyway) for the sake of brevity and subtlety. This movie was, like 2001, stunning visually,and like 2001, it was anything but brief, but unlike 2001, which contrasted subtle and blatant, this movie was almost always noise (literally- the sound layering is actually unnerving in some parts). The script felt like an incomprehensible mess at times, the acting was underwhelming (which is unfortunate because the movie's full of really talented male and female actors), and it only really bested '2001' in that it was longer (longer even than Kubrick's original premiere cut), louder, and had more straight-up action scenes. I really wanted to like this movie as I was watching it, and I actually liked the last 40 minutes or so quite a lot, which made it both harder and more necessary to admit the following: ultimately, this movie could have been so much more. Perhaps it didn't need to be '2001: A Space Odyssey:the Next Generation,' or '2001: rebooted.'Perhaps it simply needed to be 'Interstellar.'",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The second half has many goosebumps-triggering scenes. Nolan's magic is that he brings in emotions to all his films. This film had it in abundance. Towards the end of the movie, it might bring tears of joy. He has tried to explain science topics, in the most simplest form, with some added fictitious ideas, which has been put in such a way that we might end up wondering whether its real science or not. Those who're looking out for a comedy or no-brainer movie, this one is not for you. Another interesting aspect was the heavy usage of grand piano in the BGM, it complemented well with the mood.

13 November 2014,apo1978,8," Chin-scratching stuff
","I consider myself a big Christopher Nolan fan and feel he's one of the best directors around today, but I'm no fan-boy (I hate that word). With Interstellar, he has once again achieved a highly remarkable film, if not his most rewarding. Matthew McConaughey solidifies his recent string of great performances as the astronaut tasked with saving mankind. Not by saving the Earth (that's literally decaying into a dust-bowl), but by finding a new habitable planet, via a newly formed wormhole on the edge of Saturn, that leads to a new galaxy. Got it? Thankfully, Nolan retains a human touch throughout the journey by our hero's love of his daughter and his promise to return - even though they may both be the same age when he returns (that's relativity for you folks!). In fact, strip away all the astrophysics and there's simply a strong message about the power of human love. What they should have stripped away is some of Hans Zimmer's overbearing score - as it often drowns out some of the character's dialogue, making the complex space dimensional theories easy to miss and harder to understand. I love the science-stuff and it makes for interesting, thought-provoking viewing but also renders the film slightly dull and dare I say, boring, in places. Ironically, a bit like space itself – resplendent and mesmerising here, empty and cold there. Fortunately these moments are rare as the film is a pure spectacle to behold, as you'd expect by a Nolan film, from sweeping vistas to dream-like imagery – the void of space has rarely been so real. The eerily silent moments of space arguably more authentic than what ""Gravity"" recently achieved. There's no denying that Interstellar is a technical marvel and ingenious film-making but, for me, it lacks that cathartic thrill to elevate this to a higher score. I wanted to be more emotionally invested with the human drama but I was so involved in the science that the ""pull-at-the-heart-string"" moments felt oddly diluted. That said, this is a film that warrants at least a second viewing to fully appreciate it and will cause many discussions and scratching of chins for years to come.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","One of the most famous directors of our time, Christopher Nolan made his first hit with Memento"", which was based on his brother Jonathan's short story. This was followed by the lesser-known Insomnia"", then Nolan introduced himself to a bigger audience with the first part of The Dark Knight"" trilogy Batman Begins! The Batman reboot was followed by Prestige"" which he also made with the help of his brother. Then came the Nolan film which was considered to be the best so far: Inception"". After finishing The Dark Knight"" trilogy, Nolan came up with something original again. He and Jonathan grabbed a theoretical physicist (Kip Thorne) for the sake of scientific accuracy and worked over Jonathan's script which was originally written for Steven Spielberg.

7 November 2014,mwis7238,9," Ignore the hateful noise. This film is a MASTERPIECE!!
","I had been waiting to see this film ever since the first trailer for it came out months ago. Going into it I had extremely high expectations and thought that maybe I was expecting too much and may find myself disappointed after viewing the film. I then saw that it was over a 9 here on IMDb and thought to myself, ""Okay, I am sure it is good, but it cannot be this good to warrant a rating over 9."" After seeing this film I stand corrected and pleasantly so. Other than this film, the only other movies I have felt deserved a rating of 10 are The Godfather (of course) and 2001: A Space Odyssey, to which many say this film draws comparisons. I came back to IMDb to read what everyone else thought and although it is rated over a 9, there are numerous people bashing the film, saying it is overrated and others (complete fools) are even daring enough to say it was ""awful."" I like Nolan's films, but I am no Nolan ""fanboy"" which is what the haters call you if you simply enjoy one of his films. I had no idea that hating on Christopher Nolan was in style right now. That being said, ignore all the bad reviews and the ""haters,"" as they are now called. This movie was fantastic. There was emotion (you may even shed a tear or two), beautiful visuals, powerful dialogue, and a masterful score. The film is not slow either as you would expect for a 3 hour movie. It gets to the point and propels you straight into space no more than 1/3 into the film. Everyone loved Gravity last year (which I felt was overrated), and the depths of space that this film projects to us puts that film to shame. They travel the deepest into space we as humans have ever imagined and then some, reaching new worlds and discovering the unknown. Everyone says they didn't enjoy the movie because they didn't understand the ""physics,"" but if you pay attention to the film everything is easily understood; you don't need to be a physicist (which I definitely am not) to enjoy and understand what is going on around you. This was one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had, and as the credits rolled I sat in my seat in silence and awe. As everyone shuffled out of the theatre, I sat there alone watching the credits, reveling in what I had just watched and wishing there would be more. Those who dare to give this film a bad review have said there is no point in seeing it again because there is nothing new to discover, but you will find any excuse you can to watch it all over again. This movie is a MASTERPIECE. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. Let this be the review to end all reviews; ignore the outside noise and act as if you are in space where there is no noise at all.

16 November 2014,jackyates049,8," Great visuals, superb acting and 'stellar' writing!
","As a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolan's previous work I was hyped and on-board for this film from the moment it was announced. However since this film's release last week it has gained several negative reviews from YouTube movie critics claiming that it is overrated. Having now seen the film I can say that this is simply not true. I think the negative response this film has gained is down to the fact that it could never live up to the hype, therefore the final product no matter how good will always have been considered a disappointment. This does not make it over-rated but rather over- hyped. The acting from all the cast was fantastic, the characters felt real and you can genuinely relate to them, even the young girl playing 'Murph' gave a surprisingly convincing performance. The writing was brilliant, the characters spoke and acted like real people and the writers excellently blended science fiction, science fact and the theoretical. Where this film excels is definitely in the visuals. The CGi when used looks beautiful and the use of practical effects was a great choice. That being said the film was by no means perfect, there was quite a lot of scenes that were their simply for exposition (this is the same for many Christopher Nolan films) and the space between the second act and the finale of the film did begin to drag. The film was also very long and there were a couple of scenes I feel should have been chopped and cut for time reasons. Overall Interstellar was a brilliant film that is definitely up their with Christopher Nolan's best work and is definitely one of the best movies of 2014!

Well i don't understand theory of space and time that is used in the movie,,, and from a non science guy like me the gist of the movie goes as below, It is about a journey through the stars to find a new home for us as dear mother earth is becoming unstable for mankind,, and while on the run due to time and space differences in different planets in some other galaxy the earth goes much older than the crew on the craft,,, however when it seemed all hopes are lost,, cooper finds that answer to everything lied within his daughter's imagination,, with the help of the findings earth was not saved but mankind was,,, It was a sci-fi film , yet the amount of emotions of a father and daughter, a child's imagination , Dr Mann's agony out of loneliness, professor Brand's frustration of failure portrayed will leave you amazed throughout the excellent 169 minutes of your life,,, Visuals... Well such a movie that explores the possibilities of five dimensions of time should have reached the theatre with at least three,,, the black hole, worm hole , other galaxies, friction of the craft with the particles of the hole , murph's bedroom everything was made in such a way that makes you feel like watching a NASA documentary ... Background scores - Hans zimmer did an excellent work here again,, as soon as the theme was released i kept listening to it very often...

","I have been a science fiction fan for decades, I concur with one of the writers on here that this is THE film for a long time regarding science fiction. It's a long film, I cannot believe it is marked on IMDb as the same as Inception (for now) as this deals with something which to me is so within reach, exploring space and deep-space, whilst I concede we have ""a bit of a way off"" with exploring other dimensions. It is essentially an exciting film that tips the human race over the edge of what is about to come, including the nod to India's increasing economy regarding solar power. At around 3 hours long it held my attention, the story is fulfilling, the science whilst I am no astrophysicist, is absorbing the technology not too over the top, even the space suits don't look ridiculous. The special effects of certain things turn out to be a first. It does have some plot-holes, yes, but the whole film gels together for that ""suspension of disbelief"" which is what fiction is supposed to do. I was gripped, I felt involved, and I ran with the film and enjoyed it big time. My first niggle of the film was the mumbling of Cooper and poor Michael Cain seeming so old, after that my niggles disappeared though. As the film unfolded I fell into this film and was away, amongst stars, entwined in time, pulled along by gravity, wanted to solve astrophysical equations and watch myself doing that from another dimension. By the way in a million years all glass produced today would have disintegrated, in 5 billion years our Sun will start to turn into a red giant. It will take another 5 billion years for our Sun to become a black dwarf. In one hundred trillion years only white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes will remain following the degeneration of the Universe and stars will die.

To flipping over plates to keep the dust off and wearing masks to protect them from the awful dust that is slowly suffocating everyone on earth.

Coop dreams of flying a spacecraft but believes he was born 40 years too late and 40 years too early as Coop had flown for NASA many years ago, before it was disgraced for faking the moon landings to trick the Soviets into bankruptcy But had instead just gone underground, and we're working on a plan to save humanity. By sending people to space. Coop now is the only remaining experienced pilot, and NASA need him But he must make a choice: either try yet leave his Family behind, likely to never see them again.

Despite the fact that I really like Damon and McConaughey, and Lithgow, I didn't like the picture, but the actors were certainly able to take the hit on themselves and partially fill the vacuum that created the plot! Why did I point out that this is not science fiction, primarily because of the idea of time travel, because of traveling through some fantasized cosmic windows, and the metaphor of transmitting information through space and time using bookshelves did not seem to me the best, exposing the audience to idiots! If you forgot the school course, I want to note that you will not find anything about it in textbooks, do not forget that time as such was invented by us, another technique for measuring distances between celestial bodies, so such plot twists are a figment of fantasy no more, akin to a witch hunt in the Middle Ages. Of course, it is worth noting the rich visual range, shooting and Matt Dayman of our ""potato lover"", but I also want to note that the very message of the film leaves much to be desired, depicting people as a herd of locusts or rats that destroy everything and run in search of a new world that can be devoured, I agree Americans are really like that, but at the expense of other nations, I would not rush to conclusions.

","Faith and Love can transcend time and space, whether literally or scientifically. This is what Insterstellar goes out to prove. Faith in the people we love, in the promises they make, may not be a tangible thing, however that is what makes us who we are. Although the movie would be relished more by people having an interest in astrophysics, still others would love it as much. Mainly because of the way the movie is presented. The science and human emotions are so tightly intermingled, that you cannot distinguish one from another. The movie is not just about a scientific exploration but also exploring the human psyche.

Conclusion was a way too fictitious but a nice way to end the movie.I REALLY WANT TO SEE 2ND PART OF INTERSTELLAR but its not possible. On the other hand, the graphics and acting both were spectacular in the movie and i was speechless while watching the movie. I remember the the dead silence in cinema when there was a blast in the ship due to a** h**e DR MANN (nice acting bdw). That silence was amazing and there was no music no sound nothing from the space and from the IMAX. Interstellar is no doubt the best space movie of all time yet. Graphics, Story, Acting, Concept and everyone related to movie have done a marvellous, excellent and superb Job. Hats OFF Comparing to biggest blunder of 2013, Gravity movie. Interstellar deserves more then 10 Oscars. There was no reason to give 7 Oscars to Gravity Movie.i would still say the same thing that Gravity got stupid and sh***st story of all time.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Viewers warning: This is a very technical and conceptual movie which is not for everyone and it's easy for me to say unless you are a scientist or from space field it would take some repetitions and some good internet research.Be it the use of binary messages,String theory,warmhole,time dilation,fifth dimension physics,relativity, gravitational singularity,customised tessarect and many more...As far as the music is concerned hands down the best soundtrack created ever it's my personal choice though and personally I haven't ever come across such an enthralling piece of music art BGM personifies and gigantically improve the visiuals forming perfect blend.All in All in All a movie can't be made any better than this ,I personally consider Interstellar to be one of the pieces of art which is made once in a lifetime.

The movie starts with a bad story. Not so really a good starting. Nothing special at least.
Over half of the movie is full of nonsense. I see humans who are fighting with each other for the personal glorification. Ignorant astronauts who don't know anything about the space. A lot of general egoism that isn't possible to be explained except in a crazy world where there isn't any hope.
Surprisingly in the last part of the movie something changed better and you almost can feel that this is a great movie and you didn't waste almost 3 hours to watch it.
What to say? Mega cool special effects. Great graphic with the editors. Good sound to make you involved in the scene. I guess a lot of money was spent on the movie.
If I could I wouldn't give any star because it's a mix of bad and good feelings and it's hard to say what's the rank of this movie.
Of course I think the script isn't good enough. Space stories are always involving people and even if it's a bad movie that's a great way to get positive reviews after all.

Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are taking the cinema going world as close as they will probably get to see what Interstellar travel will look like and by god was it mesmerizing. I found myself saying out loud ""WOW"" like I was kid who had just seen a pair a boobs in page 3 for the first time. You can be forgiven for thinking you where probably going to see a good film because I wasn't prepared for the sheer quality of every aspect that the film possess. Even after the movie was finished I was still thinking it all out in my head which caused me to take wrong turns when I was driving home because my mind was still trying to process what I had just seen. Matthew McConaughey is such a great actor and I think those cheesy shite house films that he was previously involved in didn't have the storyline or the intelligence to show you how good an actor this guy is. It almost seems like when he took those RomCom roles that maybe he didn't believe in himself as an actor but boy does he believe in himself now. I'm going to put it out there that he is the best actor of our generation. He carried out his role with precision. He had the full cinema in the palm of his hand but let's not forget the rest of the cast who held their own in this movie. Anne Hathaway should win best supporting role at the Oscars and Michael Caine was well, Michael Caine, a man who can play any role with conviction. If you are going to see this film, make sure you go to an IMAX to see it because it was certainly made for it The wall of sound and vibrations and the cinematography was just perfection. It wasn't just a good movie but I feel like I have witnessed an epic event.

","Let me take a moment to explain my connection to this incredible film. While getting my undergrad at Ohio State, I took a class dedicated in its entirety to Black Holes. This was in 2014, and the semester perfectly coincided with the release of this film. Although I've since gone on to enter the business world, this was my favorite class of my undergraduate tenure. I had the privilege to learn from a professor who was required to take a couple of weeks off to attend a summit in Chile, as he was one of the few people on the planet qualified to work on and analyze the Hubble telescope. We spent an entire week dissecting the metrics of the film's central black hole, Gargantuan; it's spin, mass, and charge. My textbook? Authored none other than Kip Thorne, who was also the Executive Producer of this film. Kip, as you'll see in the trivia section on IMDB, had the immense task to keep all aspects of this film within the grasp of our current theoretical realm. Although elements of this film fringe on the very edge of scientific theory, the overall scientific elements of it are sound, which is why I respected it so greatly. It is a perfect converging of Hollywood and Science. This film came at the perfect time for me, and capped my favorite educational course I have ever taken, albeit far from the professional path I would end up taking. Please dismiss the campy elements of the film, perhaps realizing they simply add ""gravity"" to the plot! One of my favorite movies of all time, if you have any interest in the deep recesses of space and the *truly* unknown (as humanity has no grasp of what surrounds the central plot of this film), I encourage you to watch, and rewatch, this cinematic adventure.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The film's seed started from works of Carl Sagan way back in the 80's then Spielberg was going to make the film but handed it to the Nolan brothers. Best ""space"" movie I've seen and much deeper than average outer-space films that are usually about failing missions and portraying mostly astronauts dangling in space trying to fix crap , plus this one has a lot of heart. If you are into good film-making (especially Nolan's past works), astronomy/Universe/time and space, progressive quantum physics type of stuff/veering towards 'spiritual', you have no excuse not to see this film (however I would highly expect a film like this is way better on the big screen). If u have grown to appreciate Matthew Mcconaughey much more since his stellar role in Dallas Buyers Club and the show True Detective, I highly recommend Interstellar. It could have been shorter, and Matt Damon may have intentionally been cast (in this particular role) to prove a point that we are going to have to deal with all sorts of personalities if we want to evolve or achieve 'peace'. Overall, this project was a serious commitment and I found it very inspiring.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Freely interpreted dictated Nestor physics Isaac Newton in his third law states that to get ahead you have to leave something behind. Astronaut Cooper shows his two little things children crestfallen and angry behind if he decides to participate in a space mission to look for an alternative to the decaying planet Earth. Time is relative, says Newton - Albert Einstein, so a trip to planet candidate Number 1 for Cooper takes about three hours, but in our experience of time more than twenty-three years. Cooper looks in a few minutes the video messages from his kids for the past twenty- three years. Coopers life seems to have stopped, but that has changed dramatically from his family. Daughter Murph example as old as her father. Christopher Nolan's space epic Interstellar relies heavily on family ties. The film does Spielbergiaans and that is not surprising.

","This movie does a great job of exploring the possibilities of deep space travel including the difficulties with relativity and interstellar objects such as black holes. The main obstacles that the protagonists face are ones that plague modern physicist, showing in an understandable way why we have not traveled deep into space thus far. While not everything is entirely believable in the plot the concepts are also not unbelievable because of the unknowns within the universe of physics. If you have any interest in physics, or even if you do not, this movie is a great way to get introduced to the concepts that many physicist are working with right now. I would definitely watch this with someone that will be willing to talk to you about the ideas afterword because of how though provoking it is.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Even though this movie is part of the sci-if genre, it still moves into the territory of other genres with grace and touches on important matters of the world without being too political. It's a heart wrenching movie, that always has me in tears but also in awe, just by the way that it's been made and its portrayal of a future somewhat dystopian world. I've seen this movie in different states of mind, and each time it means something different to me, but every time it moves me and provokes my thoughts in no way that another movie does.

","Wormholes, black holes, singularity, 5th dimension...they all are in the film. Interstellar is a film about a group of scientists who must travel through a wormhole to save mankind. Being a science geek I really loved the film. The movie is simply beautiful, bold cosmic adventure story. Interstellar is grand, immersive and long that lets 'time' slip right through our eyes. The visual effects are top notch, the acting is great and there are emotions throughout the movie. Almost all about space-time is scientific and it actually gives a glimpse of future. The soundtrack is captivating: you can't deny it. One of the aspects I didn't like was the length of the film (its about 2hrs50mins), it feels drawn out near the end. And, about everyone in the movie talking about relativity, quantum physics, black-holes, event horizon, etc I just couldn't help but think how someone who isn't interested in those topics would feel.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

22 May 2016,tylervpesek,10," extraordinary!
","I was so excited for Interstellar to come out for a very long time. I waited all of deployment to finally come back and see it in a big movie theater. I even went by myself during the day and got nothing to drink or anything so there would be minimal interruptions. (I remember somebody started talking during one part and I almost lost it... but that was probably mostly the deployment talking) anyway, after hyping it up so much in my head it still did not disappoint me. While it was different a little in it's ending execution and not for the closed minded it hit every note that it needed to. Other than just a emotional, grounded and genuine science fiction film with terrific acting and visuals that leave you wondering how they even came up with it (good thing it won the Oscar for it, it definitely deserved it) I feel like it represents a deeper message for humanity to not lose our aspiration and wonder. The world is indeed filling up to the brim of people and I feel like the more that happens the more we lose touch with our humanity in a way. I feel like we lose our need to grow and evolve when everything has been done it seems like and everyone is so crowded that the quantity of life shadows the quality of it. (stay with me there is a point to what I am saying) We need to still look to space as a new world not a impossible reach. While I certainly hope we don't leave our planet to die, I do hope humanity can somehow sort it's petty differences out sooner rather than later so we can work together to once again become pioneers and go where no man has gone before and to do it with the good grace of compassion. Anyway, I'll get off of my soap box now, but in that regard this movie is almost as meaningful as passion of the Christ would be to a Christian. This movie actually made me like Matthew Mconahey (No idea how to spell that don't judge me) along with every other cast member. Not to mention the perfectly orchestrated montage of a an ending that wraps everything up together with a nice bow like Christopher Nolan does so well. Anyway, if you haven't guess by now I do indeed highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who is a human being with a active conscious. g'day.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

26 November 2014,nilanjan-nandy,9," A Movie of a Lifetime!
","Before I even begin writing my review for INTERSTELLAR, let me take this opportunity to say that most of the viewers, perhaps many of them will not UNDERSTAND the film fully, I mean watching INTERSTELLAR and claiming it's title in your 'watched movie' list is one thing, and understanding this epic is another, an entirely different ballgame, really, since this film is practically layered with emotions so deep that in quite a few moments I happened to realize that I was holding my breath for so long that my chest cavity ached, and it's not because of only a few, but very effective stunning visual effects (which is a regular feature in Christopher Nolan's movies), it's because the subtle yet, very powerful emotions and moments of this film 'hits simply below the belt' and where it really hurts! These kinds of a Movie comes once in a lifetime, and remember, it's not Jurassic Park, Titanic, Benjamin Button, Star Wars or Ben-HR, it's a simple story, a story which spans a century, spans entire lifetimes of people growing together and then again getting separated and then again coming together after many years when circumstances have changedI cannot really put it in detail or maybe I don't know how to put it at all, but I felt a similar sort of grief and joy woven together deep inside me, when I was watching INTERSTELLAR, similar to the feeling I was having watching Forrest Gump years ago! This is basically a story of a father and his daughter and the end of mankind on Earthof Human's search for another habitable galaxy, a story where Relativity, Time, Wormhole, Black hole, Space Travel and loss of dear ones are practically tossed, mixed and presented in the most delectable manner that I have ever witnessed! This movie is slow (2 hours 50 minutes approximately), going deep down into details, but relentlessly moving, stunning and heart-breaking at the same time. Mathew Mc Conoghuey as Cooper simply takes away all the adjectives in a vicious snatch from the critic! He's so good! Anne Hathaway and Michael Cain as both Dr. Brands along with a sinister character Dr. Mann played by Matt Damon simply add to the quality quotient of this movie; in a brief role as Copper's father, John Lithgow sparkles like a Dali sparkler. Love, Longing, Survival, Challenge and emotional ranges like Rejection, comes right out of the screen and hits the thinking viewer 'smack' in the face! This is my personal realization that Christopher Nolan purposely makes his films a little strange, hard to understand at least at one-go and bizarre- all at the same time but it's not that he constructs his films keeping in mind these attributes, it's his natural system that makes him a kind of director who makes films with multi layers and varied time- frame! A little Arthur Miller like time-play concept since his INCEPTION, MEMENTO, INSOMNIA or THE PRESTIGE! Another very important aspect of this film is definitely the music by 'Hans Zimmer' – a very thoughtful piece of work really which in-seams solo and somnolent pieces on the Piano, Stringed Instruments and different percussions and out seams with hackle raising Brass and String arrangements. INTERSTELLAR is an experience, and movie of a lifetime! A saga which will forever remain in the heart of the sensible and sensitive viewer!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

I'm an amateur, of course, but I can comprehend most of the basic principles of physics and math. This movie has been very accurate in terms of what we know for sure and what laws of nature do apply in our galaxy and dimension. My favorite example was the trick with the pen and the paper. We know that this is the way it produces results. Stepping into the unknown, e.g. how the worm hole actually works, this movie went with utilizing the best theories in the field. I was literally crying because I love seeing when someone is taking a scientific approach to solve a problem and is not just relying on a hunch. This was true for the entire movie.

The movie script is also completely unpredictable and unthinkable to any normal man! before watching the movie you may think that it shows how humans escape to another planet to prevent extinction. but when you see the movie it makes you wonder what else is out there! how much of it do we know! how can a man think of these events! there are some plot holes in the movie which are intentional I feel as they make you think of different possibilities which the Director definitely wants.

","Christopher Nolan does it again, the genius director has made a space epic that will define the genre for years to come. The film is deep and complex. There are two major components to every Nolan film. A) the plot b) the characters, normally the plot is Nolan's focus. And he tries to merge the grand scale story line with the characters, to create a intimate feeling with the plot. Such as in this film, Cooper's love for his daughter and the theory of relativity are merged together, as you'll see in the film. Nolan did this with inception, the dark Knight and the prestige. The visuals are mind boggling, instead using green screen and cgi, Nolan chooses to use real sets, unlike most crap today, such as avatar which looked like plastic. Nolan film is a true Masterpiece, and in time will go down with the greats. The critics of course didn't like it, the reason is simple, a) didn't have a political agenda, b)was to complex and clever. These days if it film isn't political or actually has plot is frowned a by the hot shot critics who are as bunch geezer college professors.

","I am at a loss to understand why so many people liked and reviewed positively this movie. I find it scandalous that it appears to have more positive reviews than Gravity by Alfonso Cuarón which is a giant compared to this dwarf, in all aspects including acting, story line, dialogs and the visual effects. The performance of all the actors is average but the mumblings of the main character,Matthew McConaughey, are so incomprehensible and annoying. The computer graphics always play a big role in a science fiction movie. Unfortunately the director failed even to capitalize on it and the resulting visual effects are just average. In short, please do watch this movie if you want to see for yourself how a great amount of time, energy and money can be spent to insult human intelligence in guise of science.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I was hooked on this movie form start to finish, not ll movies can do this for me but Interstellar did it with ease. There is the easy to understand story of going to look for a new planet to live on because there isn't enough food but then there is the REAL story of love and how it connects us. It took me a couple of watches to fully understand the story but every time I saw it I was so invested. The time travel element of it is done perfectly. It is actually scientifically accurate and incredibly entertaining to watch fold out. Visually the movie is stunning, any shot of the black hole was very engaging and a delight to watch. From the beginning it tells you the story of finding another planet deep deep into space but as the story goes on you realize it was about much more than that and that realization is very rewarding to understand. Even Interstellar's conclusion is wrapped up perfectly. Cooper, the main character was hit with the risks he was told about and he felt every part of them. Most movies only tell the risks of something the main character goes through but you never see them actually portrayed, but in this movie, Cooper, was told he might not make it back to see his kids and in the end he made it to his youngest daughters funeral. Overall this movie has the perfect story, visuals and emotions. It's not an emotional roller coaster but it hits you in your feels right when it should and it does it every time.

","Right off i should say I love Nolan. I adore most of his movies, and Interstellar is no exception. It is a marvelous piece of work whose visuals will be hard to forget. His shots of space and the way he played with colors is rather masterful. Maybe i expected it to be greater than what i saw, but even though i was moved by the movie i did not quite feel like he created something great with 'Interstellar.' This could be attributed maybe to his overuse of sentimentalism in the father-daughter relationship he creates. Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

McConaughy mumbled his way through it. Why cannot dialogue be clear? Some of the effects were good but some clearly cheap. Extremely unimaginative robots, for instance. Or a shot with a camera fixed to one side of a cardboard looking space ship was repeated several times. There was no variety in the planetary landscapes. The visuals inside the ships were a poor recreation of bits in Alien or 2001 - much pinched from the latter and looking decidedly inferiorto a far superior movie despite it being 45 years older. Saturn looked like a cartoon drawing. The science was pseudo nonsense. Michel Caine was poor. He did not age the same as others. On planet with 80% gravity where actors were moving about as they do on earth then allows them to leap up and down hill with a tiny boost from a jet pack. Ridiculous! Dreadful ending.

It seems like fiction, which is a lot on the screens, and the actors are recognizable, and the plot is simplest, but no, Nolan knows how to present the story in such a way that neither fans nor opponents of the director can do without thinking about it. Interstellar frightens with its timing - almost 3 hours. About 40-50 years ago, three-hour films, such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"", were the norm, but in the XXI century the changed pace of life of people affected the fact that it became difficult for viewers to incubate three hours in cinema, so the timing began to be reduced, and moviegoers were already waiting for the release of director's versions. Indeed, after the release of the third part of The Lord of the Rings and Dogville in 2003, 180-minute films disappeared from the screens.

The direction, the music, the acting, the feeling you get when the screen fades to black, there is truly no one like him. You leave the cinema knowing you've been entertained but also feel cheated somehow. Then you watch his movies a second time and you begin to change. It's a rare feeling you get that you know you're guaranteed. I could easily sit down and watch any of his movies especially memento, the prestige or inception at any time of day or any mood. About interstellar anyway, it is a lot slower than his other films, it seems too linear and straightforward for Chris. I hated the music since I heard it was the ever pleasing hans zimmer and there was a lot of hype surrounding the music alone. So I walked out speechless, not knowing how to feel. I have seen it since then and it may not be his best but it's definitely worth seeing. The imagery, music and acting are all outstanding and my heart was beating so fast on the second viewing, to me that's what you go to the movies for, to be moved!

","All of Christopher Nolan's films are obsessed with the mind. Memento is a fascinating exploration of memory, The Prestige is all about the mind being tricked, and of course Inception deals with dreams and the subconscious. What theme does Nolan tackle in Interstellar's three bold, ambitious hours? Surprisingly for a director often accused of being emotionally cold - maybe because - it's about love, the love for family and how it affects a parent. But it's also about the most fundamental human instinct, one that will always be entangled in family; the will to survive. Against the breathtaking backdrop of space, this is an intensely cinematic experience, flawed and sometimes frustrating, but engrossing all the way through. ",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Everything about this film was basically great, except for the actual story. It lumbers along quite well for the first 2 acts, and completely falls apart in the third act. The problem was that the writers (the Nolan brothers) seem to have been too lazy to work a little harder on the screenplay so that the resolution actually made sense. I have a Science background and the developments of the third act defy any kind of reality and glossed over the scientific aspects of the story. Matthew McConaughey was excellent because he grounded the film and enabled us to try to ignore the horrible plot holes, plot reversals and other inconsistencies that appeared throughout the film. It's worth seeing for the visuals and the special effects.

It's a beautiful piece of film that I recommend every one watch in the biggest screen possible. And the acting was very good in my opinion. The characters made me feel for them personally. Matthew, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain and all the others made this cast a star studded one and all gave a stellar performance for 'Interstellar'. Some minor things were different from the other films of Nolan such as the title that would always come at the end came at the beginning. But aside from these minor differences there is no doubt that it was a Nolan film, from the awesome visuals, the mind bending facts, unthinkable plot and so many others. The man deserves an Oscar for all the efforts alone he put into this film. There is no doubt that it is one of the all time greats for me. I do not speak in favor of Nolan, It's your own opinion and perspective of the film that makes you like or hate the film.

It was intelligent, it was thought provoking, it was emotional and it was everything I wanted it to be. It asks you to feel every bit of it I mean the experience was mind blowing. The visuals, the epic score, the nail biting action sequences everything was beyond awesome. Loved the entire concept of time travel, relativity and multiple dimensions (and you need a certain level of intellect to grasp it) and how it was executed. It was a bit slow pace but still had my attention till the end credits. And for the love of God it was a film, a science fiction based on theoretical concepts and even science is not able to explain most of them yet. And if you are dealing with five dimensions, there are some minor flaws and to me those flaws were nothing compared to the whole experience. Kudos to the entire cast for their stellar performances specially Mathew totally nailed his character and the father daughter relation was the heart of the entire film. To cut it short, it was a experience of lifetime (still figuring out the ending). It was not 2001: A Space Odyssey but you can easily put it up there with these all time classics. Well the bottom line is you will either love it or hate it and I loved it to bits. A straight 10/10 in my book.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Perhaps it was just the theater I saw this in but, one thing really stood-out as ""an issue"" worth comment in review. Though the movie had a good story line, good acting etc., etc., what killed it for me was the music soundtrack which was WAY to overpowering. To the point that I could not even hear a good portion of the voice soundtrack. I didn't even know what was being said half the time. The attempt to dramatize the action, the music would blare to the point that much of the audience was putting their hands over their ears as it became actually painful. That being said, the story line and the acting combined with the nicely delivered technical ""explanation of theory"" made for a thought provoking, entertaining experience.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

23 February 2019,zach-d-miller,10," Love has no limits
","When you look back at cinema will you remember movies like the Artist or The Post, or will it be Interstellar? For me, Interstellar is the pinnacle of filmmaking. Original, Breathtakingly Beautiful, and Powerful. Christopher Nolan outdid himself here. I didn't think Inception could be beat. Yes, The Dark Knight will be seen as Nolan's Mona Lisa to most, but there's one element missing or lacking, and that is love. Yes Bruce Wayne loves Rachel, and gets his revenge, but the heart-wrenching and heart-string pulling love isn't there like it is in Inception and Interstellar. Christopher Nolan's original material has one common thread, save for Dunkirk, and that is The beauty and Power of Love. In Inception, Dom did everything to see his kids and to be reunited with them. In Interstellar, Cooper goes on a mission across space and time to secure his kids future, who are on a dying planet. While the decisions may at first glance seem to be selfish and unloving, the grand reveal at the end reaffirms to you that Love transcends everything and that the main protagonists were right to do what they did. The last scene where Dom is reunited with Murph is one of the most overwhelmingly powerful moments in movie history , despite being so short. But the length of that scene is deliberately done so that you have no time to stew on it. Cooper was a father first and a hero second, and that is the way it should be. Interstellar is a space opera, a blockbuster epic, and a love story. True cinema. There's no axe to grind, there's no social justice they are trying to achieve, it is just simply how movies should be made. I said this with Inception, but Interstellar will be impossible to beat, but knowing Christopher Nolan, he will probably beat it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I can say, without a shadow of doubt, that I enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed all three hours of this movie. There are however some problems that prevent me from giving it a higher overall rating. First off, one that you may have heard before, has to do with the sound mixing. While the score is great, it often drowns out the dialog making it hard to hear anything that is being said, especially by the close to whispering lead, Matthew McConaughey. The other problem I had was with some of the scenes in general. The cast goes about doing things that, quite frankly, you don't need to see. Set the tone with dramatic music though and man do you have some intense button pressing. Otherwise, for a movie that plays out like a sci-fi drama, it has a good dose of action in it.

Additionally, Cooper began to do something akin of plucking a ""string"" when in the library of time within the black hole, and in doing so he was communicating across the dimension Murph was in via gravity, hence the closed loop graviton string proposed in string theory. Also, all this talk about extra dimensions, reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general relativity, etc falls back on string theory. So, I feel like this movie took a lot of it's imaginative ideas from string theory. I know...I've said the phrase ""string theory"" too many times already, forgive me. Anyways, I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts about this, so what do y'all think?",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I went in to the cinema with high expectations of this film, and to be honest half way through i was disappointed due to my own preconceived notions, but then as soon i realized the direction the film was headed and what it was trying to convey i was overjoyed. Very rarely does a film try to break new ground on a scale that this film does and even more rarely does the film succeed and deliver with such power conviction and class. Interstellar takes us on a journey quite like no other, not only does it take us on a journey in the literal sense but it also journeys through the mind and the soul in an effort to display and explain the human condition and what is very likely to be our next chapter of existence. The acting is superb nothing less than flawless with Matthew McConaughey taking center stage in what i believe will be called the greatest role of his life, as a father I related to his character on many levels but it was his thirst for adventure and his desire to succeed i found most endearing. Without a doubt this was my greatest cinema experience, my heart was pounding I was on the edge of my seat with tears in my eyes and wonder in my soul. From the staggeringly breath taking visuals to the heart string tugging sentiment to the shear intelligence of the story telling, Interstellar is a piece of art that marvels at the wonders of man and the unknown, that in turn we as viewers should marvel at in owe.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

It illustrates it in a way I've not seen since the original Planet of the Apes from 1968. Most sci-fi avoids it because it can over complicate the plot but it is scientific fact. Space and time ARE linked and heavy objects like planets, stars and black holes slow your progress through them.

This is not to belittle the greatness of Clarke & Kubrick, but to lament why Christopher took half a century to do this for us, after ""2001:Space Odyssey"" kept up our interest on the subject for 3 generations.Perhaps Nolan was too busy exploring the quality of evil in ""Dark Knight"" and the possibility of interjecting our dreams with it, evil, that is,in ""Inception"",or perhaps he wasn't even born when a friend of mine and i trooped off on a Sunday morning in Delhi City,both of us about 17,to watch HAL do his/it/IBM thing in the early 1970's!But that is all in the past and Nolan avoids the past like the plague because he believes we are now,in the future,in a blight which is worse than a plague,despite having turned our artificial intelligentsia of TARS,KIPP & CASE into friendly neighborhood explorers!And while the origins of mankind is passé,school-book stuff if you know your Darwin,what mankind really needs is to dust off its ambiguity,its indecisiveness,its procrastination,its revisionist agrarianism (which is the killing cause of dusty death on Earth)to go way boldly further than simply star trekking or hitch-hiking on a much more serious mission to find another planet to survive on!What makes INTERSTELLAR simply the greatest sci-fi movie ever is that Christopher Nolan makes the search and the need for the alternative so urgent,so immediate,so critical,so now or never that you are at the edge of your seat for close to 3-hours and ready to fly out at the end of the movie to go find your space craft,your space shuttle,your space crew, your sartorial space suit, and lift off on your mission to make sure that mankind, born on Earth doesn't end up dying in it! In the process you discover the inward collapsing black hole,the corridor creating cosmos connecting worm hole,the all-of-time at one-time tesseract - what the Hindus call the 'tatra' - the 'that'(tat) - the 'there'(tatra),the book shelf with the prompting books & the ghost behind it prompting you which is you,the watch and not just time as a dimension but the timely dimension & the circularity of it,the feminine principle, and the triumphant return, not as a fetus to end some silly war on Earth but over a century younger,relatively speaking,a deus ex machina ready to take off all over again...you yourself , an alien an extra- terrestrial in INTERSTELLAR who discovers that EARTH is simply an anagram of HEART, spun over and over again,by the gravitational pull that we FEEL attraction!

So, it stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Micheal Cane, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck and someone else (i'm not going to say in case you don't know). They all put on the bet performance of their entire career in this movie! I've seen INTERSTELLAR exactly 14 times because i love it that much plus i never get tired of it! Although i love this movie like crazy, it's not perfect. No movie is perfect! My flaw with this movie was the script in 2 scenes. That's it! Other than my 1 flaw with INTERSTELLAR. Nothing else is wrong with this moviein my opinion. I thought this movie was emotionally intense and very well acted. The one scene where Matthew McConaughey cries, is some of the best acting i've ever seen. Everybody in this movie did an amazing job. Just so you guys know, i'm listening to the soundtrack for INTERSTELLAR while i'm writing this review. It really gets me in the zone! Anyways, I think that some parts of the movie are hard to follow but there are some scenes that are understandable and very well thought out science wise. There is a lot of talk about the 4th and 5th dimension which gets rather confusing but some scenes that take place in different dimensions are without a doubt some of the most mind-blowing things I've ever seen.

There isn't a single scene that can be simply skipped to make for a quicker viewing. Every second builds the atmosphere, giving hints, making the viewer think, making the viewer feel.

","First of all, i wanna say that this movie really reminded me how life on Earth is magnificent and beautiful, which was probably one of the purposes of this masterpiece. Movie really has an excellent story, and it's very interesting since beginning til the end. Dialogs are very good and original, with perfect dose of humor for serious movie like this, and of course with right dose of emotions as well. Speaking of emotions, characters don't bore viewers with too long crying and grief in the scenes, but there is enough of this moments to make movie look realistic as Sci-Fi can be. There are a lot of details that give us a lot of information end explanation that make movie realistic from different angle(not just emotionally, but scientifically). People do what would they probably do in real life, if they find themselves in hard situations from the movie. I like that the movie follow story from two different angles (from people of Earth, and from astronauts themselves). Visuals was really good and entertaining, with amazing special effects. All in all this movie is one of the best, if not the best Sci-Fi movie of all time.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I actually enjoyed this movie. More on that, and why later.
Why, oh why, do we need to have movies last over 2 hours?
Seriously? No really SERIOUSLY?
What does an extra 49 minutes convey to an audience that 2 hours could not with careful editing.
I think it's a ploy, to buy more $10 popcorn and $5 beverages, oh and to miss part of the film while you visit the bathroom without a pause button at your disposal.

24 August 2022,philipdrummond,7," Good film
","Good film. 'Interstellar' carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight. Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film captures emotion like nothing I've seen in the theaters for years. The music, visuals and characters are all true art. We've grown so used to big budget superhero flicks every month that when something like this comes along that can only truly be appreciated at a deeper level we think its unfinished. It's greatest flaw is that though I understand the emotions of all the characters at an incredibly deep level, I don't truly understand the characters themselves. This is most likely why critics have been saying Nolan went too big. If the film had been another hour of character development it would have been perfect.

","What Christopher Nolan accomplished with Interstellar will go down as one of the most astonishing space odyssey's ever created, even more beautiful than the late great Stanley Kubrick's; whom many consider to be the greatest/most influential film maker of all time. However, where 2001 undoubtedly has many dry spots, interstellar keeps you hooked from start to Finnish; and it will instill a new concept of how time and gravity can be intertwined and a fresh twist on the theoretical physics often being played with in sci fi novels. Interstellar contains a perfect blend of music/acting/writing/cinematography/directing that truly come into fruition during the Space station docking scenes. I often compare Interstellar with 2001: A Space Odyssey but in reality they're two completely different films, what truly pulls the two towards one another is their ability to inspire.

Why did the character started running on a water she knew nothing about.

","Quite simply one of the most breathtaking films I have ever seen in my life! Christopher Nolan has really proved himself with this one. The visuals were outstanding a definite shift away from the Pfister DP relationship that have delivered so many great movies. The depictions of space and various angular shots accompanied to the stunning Zimmer sound-scape at times left my jaw wide open in awe. Even if this film was 4 or 5 hours I could have gone on, every moment left me wanting more. Another factor that plays key importance in a Nolan film is the amazing ensemble cast he always seems to secure, and everybody more than brought there A-game to this picture. I have absolutely no shame in admitting I became weary-eyed at times throughout the film, something I haven't done in any movie before, such was the testament to the brilliant acting and choice direction these moments had in screen time. Don't let the detractors put you off with complaints of ""plot holes"" and comments of ""it didn't make sense!?"".

It was very difficult to understand the dialogue and if your first language is not English, you are going to have trouble. At times, the background sound almost obliterates the dialogue, but this could have been the satellite feed.

","Interstellar, started off as geek porn. Then it became confusing. Then it left you staring at credits, wondering what the heck Christopher Nolan just had you watch. I was mad at first. I was mad that Christopher Nolan ruined what could have been one of the greatest films of the year. I thought that Nolan's idea of interstellar space travel, could've made the next star wars. But it didn't. And I'm glad. Instead Nolan made a movie that tried to explain the unexplainable. It tried to explain black holes, world's with more than three dimensions, and so much more. While, at the same time, having a beautiful plot, that aims to get the theme across, that love transcends time and space. But it didn't... At first. Walking out of that movie theater I was mad. Mad because I was confused. I didn't understand the bigger picture, yet. I only started to understand it when I got back home, and I just thought about it. And I'm not sure I quite understand all of it, when I'm writing this review right now. But the best movies, are the ones that make you think.

","I absolutely love this film. I'm also a fan of Christopher Nolan's films. This movie was genius, the way it was written. The visual effects blow my.mind. I find myself rewinding it every time they go through to the other galaxy.. also, when Cooper ejects his craft and ends up in between I don't know what to call it, I try to imagine myself in that position. Even I, just watching it, was panicked seeing him watching himself leave his daughter from another dimension. The only thing I didn't like was how his character was made to never see his children again. I felt like he didn't have enough emotion towards the realization that he was possibly never going to see them again. I mean ,I'd be crying and freaking out from up there. Of course he had to focus on the problem at hand, but he missed their whole lives. And it didn't seem as if he was remorseful enough in the end when he watched murp on her death bed..I would never have left. I mean, after not seeing her for 23yrs, I'd have talked to her about what really happened and apologize over and over. But that's the way it was written. Of course he actually helped save the world by Morse coding to murph via another dimension with Tars help, but he should have been able to return to earth with his children..on the other hand, it is refreshing to see a movie without happy endings. You know, where the audience is left surprised. Where things don't always work out. A typical ending would be, they returned to earth, he gets back to his kids and they save the world. This movie was awesome because it didn't work that way. But it still bothered me. His daughter and son had a life without him. It's saddening. Didn't like that feeling, but it happens.

","Now, in this third act of the film, it all comes to life with unparalleled strength. Nolan poses and answers questions that raise others. But he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love, that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them. But Nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy. From my point of view, only Solaris by Steven Soderbergh (2002), unfortunately neglected by the audience, was able to accomplish that. Interstellar is based on a premise which is the following : from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time, we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species, as we always leave a part of ourselves ""behind"" us. In other words, I could say that this is a human story, and even if we go as far as we want to, if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of, we will only get closer to them. Because the separation, and thus the distance and time, can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other. Because it is going to the end of the world, when we reach the end of ourselves, that we reach the singularity of the ""black hole beyond the horizon"" * : it is our humanity. No, I wasn't been able to find any bad flaws in the film. Not one, and I'm still looking. After all, Interstellar is like gravity, ""all it takes is a little push !",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Unless you're well-versed in the physics of wormholes, don't expect to understand the intricacies of Interstellar's science. And there's a lot of science, most of which sounds unbelievable, but it gets the story where Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who co-wrote the film), need it to go -- from the dust-smothered and scorched Earth to the dangerous outer reaches of space. The visuals are gorgeous, and not just in space, where Coop and his fellow astronauts -- Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley), Romilly (David Gyasi), and the wise-cracking militarized robot, TARS, voiced by Bill Irwin -- travel from planet to planet, but also back on Earth, where time is passing so quickly that Coop's now grown children have all but lost faith that they'll see him again. Occasionally the time-bending storyline starts to feel like it's stretching time for viewers as well, but somehow the missions -- both the one to save mankind and Coop's personal one to see his kids -- are compelling enough to keep audiences interested. McConaughey balances the line between dead serious, sarcastic, and heartfelt, and he plays well off of his co-stars (particularly his space team). Both the young and adult versions of Murphy are perfectly cast, and Caine -- whose professor has a penchant for quoting Dylan Thomas' poem ""Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night"" -- provides elder-statesman gravitas as he did in Nolan's Batman films. As Hathaway's character explains, love is a force that transcends time and space, so if you feel invested in Coop's promise to Murphy (and, to a lesser degree, his son, who grows up to be played by Casey Affleck), you'll forgive some of the confusing and convenient plot loops and concentrate on the possibility that at some point, this father will embrace his children again. Definitely recommend this movie to everyone.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

He makes mistakes, admits them and tries to correct them.

","This is a typical Nolan movie. If you have'not liked his previous works, better stay off this. The movie starts a little slow explaining about the future, when corn is the only cultivable crop. Gravitational anomalies are occurring and strangely more to a girl in her room with bookshelves.This leads Cooper to NASA which functions unofficially. The movie picks its pace from this point and for the next 150 minutes will be a gripping ride. Hope and despair drive the movie. Wormholes, gravitational anomalies and dimension are the scientific concepts explained well in the movie. Really enjoyed the interaction of Cooper with the AI named TARS. The effects are enjoyable from wormhole to the landscapes in new planets and the docking scene. To build a story with such a few characters , to make it interesting and putting our intelligence to test,only Nolan brothers could do. There are logical loop holes too. The time duration in the planet near wormholes and our time duration are not explained properly. They just talk and it just happens. The biggest disappointment for me is, they land in the two new planets exactly on the same place as their previous explorers. I don't think it is possible especially in situations where gravity and time are different.The ending of the movie is left to anyone's guess. Performances wise, everyone fit the bill. Cinematography if not spellbinding(like Wally Pfister)is decent. Does not drag at any point of time in screenplay. Overall a good movie worth watching.

It might be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun intended), but it doesn't change the fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting is actually pretty good maybe not the best but they pull it off very nicely The plot of the film does take a bit of thought and could either make complete sense to you or be seen as lacking any form of real intelligence, I think it depends on your understanding of the concepts presented or limits of suspension of disbelief depending on how you view film. I do think the idea of trying to find a new planet that is a suitable replacement for earth is a fun plot that while has been done before still has so many avenues to explore.

Solving the story, but I'll give it all I got of what I felt with this story. Time seems to be something mankind doesn't sit down and really appreciate. The time to really adore life. The time to realize there are heroes in the world. The time to simply get lost into a film like I have. When will our time end? Out of all the wonders of the impeccable writing in this film, finding a new planet, different dimensions, the one thing that simply tugged at me was Love. He lost his time to see his family grow up. To have those genuine moments with one another. I feel like he wants to bring that out of the viewing audiences. Maybe the impossible in this world, can just be possible. What we thought wouldn't be possible for Cooper..With a little faith, and love... Maybe we will appreciate the time with our loves ones. We take it for granted.. If Cooper could just bend time.. Go backwards.. Enter a new dimension, Just to relive it.. To watch his family grow up.. That's what he really wanted to know... How many years do humans waste today not caring about anything.. Being selfish.. Just on a daily routine with a job or activity over and over, forgetting your loved ones. Missing events, even just a simple birthday party that means the world to that person with you being there. If we, do not have time to love and cherish our time with our families now, then it will be to late in the end. Missing my niece grow up... Being away from my mom who has done everything for me who now needs my help, Missing out on my sisters second pregnancy... Missing my dad, when we never really shared our bonding time before, and now he's getting older... My sister who takes flight everyday.. All of my Family. My beloved friends who have kept by my side for years now..When I can easily just speak with all of them over the technology provided to us today. When will their time be up? We all think a long long time in our heads, but is it? I've taken a lot of my time for granted....The emotion in this film has obviously touched me.. I'll even take the time to recognize that there are many heroes in the world. Christopher Nolan, you are now one of my Heroes. I don't even know you personally, and that's okay because your work moves me. You're a Legend Mr. Nolan, You will probably never even see this..

It's a balanced combination of last year's ""Gravity"" of Cuarón (released exactly one year ago, on November 7, 2013), and ""Inception"" (2010), directed also by Nolan, with very clear influences from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""(1977) of Spielberg and the ""The Abyss"" (1989) of Cameron. Throw in the mixer the ""Contact"" (1997) of Zemeckis (in which oddly was playing also McConaughey) and -voilà-: Behold the ""Interstellar""! Even so, the direction of Nolan is, as always, excellent, while the audiovisual part nothing less than exquisite. The photo of Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking, while for the Hans Zimmer's soundtrack what to say, the man is ""from another planet"". The melancholic motif we listen to throughout the film is really a masterpiece. And then we reach the ""black hole"" of the film, which is not other than the script. Firstly, it should be noted that the film is to a very large extent scientifically accurate. The theoretical physicist Kip Thorne was general consultant of the film, from the design and preproduction to shooting and visual effects, and the brother of the director and screenwriter of the film, Jonathan Nolan, studied several of the chapters of the ""Theory of Relativity"" at the California Institute of Technology, while writing the screenplay. As Thorne said: «Whatever you see on your screen is based on the General Theory of Relativity of Einstein».   On the other hand, however, the screenplay of ""Interstellar"" faces a problem: It devotes much of the film to human relationships, which (although I'm sure that was written with the best of intentions), unfortunately is grafted with countless moments of dramatical cliché, which is trying to hide behind the direction of really great Nolan. Sometimes it succeeds, sometimes not. But these 169 minutes (which are not as tedious as they sound) should not for any reason conclude with such a simple message as: ""Love is the driving force of the universe."" So when I listen to critics and say: ""Interstellar"" is great, but Nolan is not Kubrick», they are undoubtedly right. Even so, no doubt that the ""Interstellar"" is a film that should be seen in the dark movie theater and especially a huge screen, not on TV or on your PC, when eventually come out in Blu-Ray. Personally, I will see the movie for a second time, because, despite of the drawbacks, the ""Interstellar"" is not a movie that will be forgotten easily and, if anything, Christopher Nolan is a master when he wants to give -food for thought- to the hungry for movie audience.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","When I walked out of the theater, I couldn't talk about the movie. I couldn't comprehend the surge of feelings I was experiencing. I couldn't just accept the fact that this was the greatest movie I have ever seen, one that would affect me so deeply, move me so profoundly. This isn't just any science fiction movie,this is a journey through time and space. This is a hard hitting message to all the people of science out there - It is you that make science what it is today. It is your humanity, your emotions, your feelings that shape the science to which this world owes so much. Science isn't just the underlying principle; it isn't just the sub atomic particle that behaves in a way that quantum physics can predict, it isn't just the underlying physiology that a doctor can understand; it isn't just a puzzle to be cracked; it isn't just an equation to be solved. Science is what we want it to be. Science is that hidden motivation inside of us that wants to make this world a better place, that wants to understand our place in this universe.But what is it that pushes us to make these breakthroughs everyday? It is the people around us. It is the love we have for them , it is the fear of that indescribable torment of losing someone that matters so much, that pushes us to break boundaries. What will happen if we ever let artificial intelligence do our science? Will that be the end of the era of discoveries? These are questions that I hope will never need an answer. I am not going to review this movie. I thought I wouldn't even talk about it. I wanted to selfishly relish how overwhelmed I felt by it, and the profound effect it had on me. But I couldn't stop thinking about this movie; I couldn't help but be amazed at how Christopher Nolan shook my belief and threw me, not into darkness, but into the path of a blinding light I still feel overpowered by. The only way I can truly understand what I went through in those three hours is to write about it. For the first time since I fell in love with movies, that my jaw dropped and I spent most of the movie with my mouth wide open , in awe of the brilliance that Nolan has delivered. The reality of relativity does not lie in the difficulty to understand or predict in its entirety, but in humanities collective reaction to it. Nolan's compelling portrayal of emotions we have never felt, realities that would seem too absurd to even imagine, shocked me and and my core beliefs. Nolan rekindled the love of science in me and made my ask myself - what if? And this is why I am still in disbelief at his work.

I love all of Christopher Nolan's movies so I may be a little biased, but if you watch it you will understand why I feel so strongly about this movie. The ending was by far the best part. I won't say anything because I don't want to spoil it, but the ending is a huge twist which makes the movie 100 times better than it already was. I absolutely loved this movie and after heavy consideration, I could say that this movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. I don't commonly write reviews for movies, but I felt I must for this one due to the numerous people that didn't like this movie. Don't read the negative reviews, just watch it and you'll love it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","When i first heard about this movie, i had only seen the trailer about 2 times, that's it. I remember i was out at a restaurant that was by my local movie theatre, and i saw that the movie was playing. Since i was bored and had nothing else to do, i decided to go watch it for fun. Now what i expected from this movie was just another small space movie like gravity, or just a typical normal movie. Then after i saw this, it changed everything. I was just blown away. I couldn't believe how amazing this movie was, it was unlike anything i had ever experienced in a movie before. For the first time ever in my life of going to the movies, this film had me at the very edge of my seat. The story is amazing, and you really feel for the characters in the film. The movie has a farmer named Cooper, who has a daughter named Murph and a son named Tom. When the Earth is starting to become uninhabitable for humans, NASA chooses Cooper and a crew of other astronauts to go out into interstellar space through a wormhole to look for another world. The problem with this though is that Coopers children don't want to leave, its mostly Murph that is heartbroken, and throughout the film you really see how beautiful this film truly is. The music was absolutely amazing, and the special effects made you feel you were truly out in space. This movie is unlike any other movie i have ever seen, it really kept me at the edge of my seat. The fact that Cooper is trying to get back home to his daughter when up in space is really emotional, and the scenes are breathtaking. This movie is absolutely perfect, its inspiring, emotional, and beautiful. 10 out of 10. Also, i read some of the bad reviews, and honestly the reasons they gave for hating this film are absolutely stupid. I saw stuff like, ""Too boring"" ""No action"" ""Too much talking"" i mean is that what movies are really about these days? I thought it was about the story, how good it is, and these bad reviews just show that those people who saw this movie are nothing but idiots who are too lazy to actually follow the TRUE MEANING of the film, not just if there's enough stupid action scenes.

Essential impression was a cross between The Right Stuff and 2001 with a well thought out dab of relativity/time travel. Acting was very good with a possible Oscar nod toward McConaughey. Same can be said about the screenplay and script. Underlying the hard story and eventually intertwined with it is a moving tribute to family and moral decisions. Multiple values and viewpoints are presented which, while differing and at odds with each other, manage to avoid falling into ""good vs. bad"" arguments. All the decisions made by the major characters can be morally defended even while they conflict. If you like hard science sci-fi without the ""monsters from beyond"" trope, go see it.

But Nolan is probably one of the very few film-makers with audacity and talent to go beyond the usual summer blockbuster, and create his own universe.

Don't bother about the reviews, this is a ride across the universe you have to take at least once. Take a bow Nolan, probably the best storyteller of this generation.

","Nolan's involvement brought science fiction movies to a new height. You don't need a chair to watch Nolan's movies, because you have to kneel down and watch it. If Einstein is still alive, you will pat him on the shoulder and do a dirty job: boy, your TM is great. In high-scoring science fiction works, you can always see his name, ""Batman - Dark Knight"" is crushing the existence of all the Marvellous films, even subdued to destroy the hegemony. Wormholes, black holes, multi-dimensional space, through the interstellar, the scientific basis of the work is solid, rich in content, shocking pictures, ups and downs of the plot. The vast universe, human beings are so small. In the multidimensional universe, everything can be quantified, time will slow down, an hour is equivalent to seven years of the earth, can live to the future, only love, will not be quantified, is the ultimate link between people, Cooper's love for family, for friends, and not because of the distortion of time and space. If ""Wandering Earth"" has made a good start for Chinese science fiction movies, then ""Star Crossing"" is an example that we are catching up with.

A shorter (and faster paced) script would have made this a true science fiction masterpiece. Also, the sound quality was not great. At times I had to strain to hear the dialogue been spoken.

I love Nolan and what he did with the Batman franchise but the lack of a climactic ending kind of ruined it for me and was depressing with everything that happened to his daughter. It did push boundaries which was cool and was one of the first movies you really get to see what time travel would be like but it was a little underwhelming.

","I think most of the sci-fi movies are based on stupid story. Things are just don't make sense. No logic at all.. When earth on food crisis, and had to live on corn only, all those people survived over 20 years? Earth on that stage, yet you still see American flag, beer( oh maybe its corn beer) a 4x4 looks new and from this era, also one of its tire goes flat while cooper can manage to hack a unmanned plane? Dr Mann ( Matt Damon) has cried, because he hasn't seen a man for a long time and yet he tries to kill them? There are many other stuff that I can list of.. When you make a movie with a good budget, please please add some logic. In the movie Armageddon, 3 days (or so) left for the impact, and yet they can still call a taxi.. One of the most logical Sci-fi movie I have ever seen, was The Matrix. Yes few things you can say about that movie, but in terms of logic, the film makes sense.. I'm sorry Nolan.

","Directed by Christopher Nolan, Interstellar was a fantastic movie that encompassed everything from a second Dust Bowl to physics to space exploration. The plot of the story was a little hard to follow and towards the tail end of the film became extremely confusing. The movie begins by vaguely explaining that the world has suffered another Dust Bowl, resulting in limited food and resources. The conditions got so bad in the movie, the characters were forced to wear protective goggles, cover their mouths, and set plates/cups upside down to prevent dust intake. Thus, propelling the movie forward. The dusts implications were large as crops such as wheat and okra have become extinct with corn as one of the last remaining sources of food. As the story continues we come across a secret organization (NASA) working on saving civilization through space exploration and the theory of harnessing gravity to ensure the human race would survive, just on a different planet.

11 February 2020,alexaanderton,7," Nat Hazards of Drought
","This movie is very dramatic and follows a few central themes of a dangerous life in space or a dying world on Earth. There is no distinguishable music, only an intense score that plays at the most stressful moments during the movie. The main character, Cooper, or Matthew McConaughey is seen as a distant father figure who leaves his family behind in order to travel through a black hole on Saturn. The point of this mission is to explore twelve potential new planets for humans to live on as the Earth is dying. The family lived on a farm that was often caught in major dust storms that required people to wear masks, hide in their homes, and eventually people left the town. The farmers also struggled with major drought, blight, dust, and the dying of their crops. Drought is a very dangerous natural hazard because people and animals will die without access to main food groups such as corn or wheat. Cooper's son responded to the dust with denial even though his wife and child coughed incessantly. This goes to show how a disaster can directly affect people, yet they will refuse to leave their home.
Cooper travels through space with a small crew on a small ship, all of which is from a NASA secret headquarters. He is one of the main pilots and engineers who is able to quickly solve but also fly the ship as to conserve fuel. Most of the space-science seemed to be portrayed accurately but I have no experience therefore it could have all been fake. The crew was also accompanied by an AI-like robot named Tars. This robot helped the crew solve problems, fly the ship, and gave them information when requested. Also, it was discovered that the professor who sent the crew knew that this mission was doomed to fail all along because of a stupid equation. Even his own daughter, Brand, or Anne Hathaway, didn't know this and was left in tears when she received a video message explaining this.
If the world was dying, why would a father leave his children behind to ""starve to death?"" The world or NASA should have used their advanced technology lab to find a way to make more food. I am assuming this movie is set in a post-futuristic world where humans are quite literally watching their crops die and families struggle for food. Yet, the movie nearly ends with Cooper stuck in a 3rd or 5th time dimension where he is able to ""talk"" to a younger version of his daughter through morse code and binary. This was very confusing as to how he went from being lost in space, stuck in time, and then ended up in a hospital bed on a station in space. Overall, I do really like this movie but I had to watch it multiple times to come to this realization.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2020,cali_may,10," The Science/Natural Disasters of Interstellar
","Interstellar is a wonderfully made science fiction movie with very accurate representations of both modern science and natural disaster. In this film, Matthew McConaughey plays the role of a former NASA pilot named Cooper, who is an ambitious father that is willing to do anything for the sake of his children in a time where all of mankind is struggling to survive. The movie opens up with the image of a severe dust storm wreaking havoc over the U.S., as well as the whole world, which results in a terrible global crop blight. This type of natural disaster is one that the U.S. knows all too well after the Dust Bowl of the 1930's, as well as one that could occur at any time and was depicted very accurately. This has led to the realization that Earth can sustain its inhabitants no longer, and that something has to be done to save the future of mankind.
Cooper's family is struggling to put food on the table and make it by when he is approached by a brilliant professor named Dr. Bland, who is played by Michael Caine. Dr. Bland proposes his idea of travelling through a blackhole to another galaxy, or interstellar travel, in hopes of attempting to decide on one of three planets for mankind to call home in an attempt of repopulation and sanctum. Upon travelling through the wormhole and arriving on distant planets, the space team is faced with numerous obstacles. For example, the team comes face to face with huge tidal waves that stay stationary as the planet moves underneath, slamming the team and their ships into the water. Tidal waves are something very common on Earth and very detrimental to places such as the tropics. The level of destruction from these waves, as well as all the expanse of the tidal wave, that was represented in the movie was very accurate.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

That was the standard he and the other producer came up with at the inception of this film. Some things are not likely but they're still possible. Knowing this really made the movie surreal for me especially the gravitational lensing, time dilation and extra dimension elements of the film. The story itself is beautiful and hopeful but being backed by real science is what made this film exceptional.

","I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, was not completely engaged. I felt that in some how the last part was forced to conclude the film in a very different way the film was being directed. I thought that the immersive, technically accurate and emotional first part didn't correspond to the final acts. But after seeing this a few more times, I think the end is precisely what Nolan wanted for his film. It is emotionally driven and sometimes not everything can be explained with physics. This is a masterpiece and for me the scene where Matt Damon tries to dock in the Endurance is the best action scene I've seen in many years. Acting is really good, specially McConaughey, Hathaway and Caine, bringing into life some memorable characters. However there are some minor flaws, no one can compare to the strengths of this movie. I recommend you to search for videos explaining how Nolan and his team draw for the first time a black hole using the physics law, or how they filmed the first planet full of water.

","The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting.

","WOW.. For the first time upon viewing a film never have i been speechless Till this Sci-Fi Masterpiece.. I will try to keep this review short as it is my first ever doing one, this film is not just a movie constructed from the brilliant mind of Christoher Nolan.. No it's not.. it is a guide.. a visually stunning monumental 169min journey that takes us far beyond space and time. It is a very basic story of Earth a dying planet that forces man kind to take a leap of faith that involves a mission to surpass the limitations of Interstellar Travel and find habitable planets that can sustain human life. But with out giving anything away.. its a story of what it means to be a human being and the emotions we all encounter in certain situations and our actions to how we respond to it. Me being a long time Nolan fan.. I have to say it is his best and most personal work i have seen since Inception and The Prestige, That Shines brighter than both combined! And i will say this.. Some people will dislike it for one main reason.. ""They will not understand"" And thats fine! Interstellar is not the type of film that asks you to understand it straight away.. instead it asks to you ""FEEL IT"" To observe it.. and think about it.. Because in reality it is an amazingly crafted film, From Hans Zimmer's epic yet beautiful Organ Scoring to the emotional performances of Matthew McConaughey,Jessica Chastain,Michael Caine and Newcomer Mackenzie Foy.. To the cinematography/VFX work of such never seen before in a Sci-Fi film! Mr. Nolan Has Given us something lost in the cinematic world of movie making for the last 30+ years since the first Star Wars movie and 2001:Space Odyssey and that is ""Exploration"" it pulls us from our seats into the dimension of the unknown.

It does lose the latter's confusion and it adds another layer of modernity which, I think, is needed nowadays. At the same time it is indebted to Kubrick's aesthetics. Of space opera.

","Interstellar is amazing in terms of photography, setting, special effects and ideas. The close future where earth is doomed and humans are looking desperately for a way to survive is masterly created and transmits a vivid anguish. The trip to the unknown and the references to literature help give the film a solemn, contemplative air. The problem comes, in my opinion when the omnipresent, worn-out American rhetoric steps in, and turns it into a film like anyone we have already seen. The hero; the importance of keeping promises; the positiveness; the happy ending, the flag of the States that saves humanity. It makes all so unrealistic and boring. I honestly would have appreciated a more courageous Nolan. What if we travelled that far to find nothing but inhospitable worlds, cold, desolation and darkness? After all, the reference to Conrad's ""The Hearth of Darkness"" in the film seemed to link Cooper to a revisited Marlow, who in search of hope, but finds only ""horror"". Life isn't only fulfilled hope and good endings. Sometimes it doesn't work like that. Sometimes a promise simply can't be kept. Sometimes we can't fix mistakes and to be able to see the bad consequences of our actions in the future would transmit much deeper insights of the present we are living.

I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though.

","I'm not going to pretend I knew Christopher Nolan back in his beginner years. After all, I'm only 23 - I was 9 when Memento first came out, and even then, I thought it was an interesting concept... but I was quickly distracted by my Pokémon Red version and Dragon Ball Z TV shows. I have grown up in a world of my own - constantly trying to understand things, always asking why I'm here, and trying to find certainty amongst the chaos. I suppose that's what led me to pursue a mathematics degree, and it's also the part of me that has now idealised Christopher Nolan's brain as the 8th wonder of the world.

","Great movies are not made every day nor every year, and who knows how long we will wait to see a movie as good as that one. Interstellar was perfect in every aspect I could think of. I wanted to know what the protagonists are going to do yet wanted the movie to stay rolling as much as possible. All the actors really played their roles perfectly. I just want to give Academy awards to all of them. Matthew McConaughey is officially my top favorite actor of all time. I first saw him in Failure to Launch and I thought he was going to be a mediocre actor. However, this year I saw him in We are Marshall, Dallas Buyers Club, True Detective, and now Interstellar, and now I believe he is staying in Movie History. He succeeds in touching me in every role he plays. Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain also played their roles perfectly. Christopher Nolan. I do not know what to say. One thing I love about his movies is that not a single frame in the whole movie is useless or irrelevant to the plot of the movie. Every tiny thing that occurs on the screen is for a reason. He just succeeds on making me concentrate and leave everything I am doing to watch the movie. The sound effects and the special effects are perfect also. The screen writing is beautiful u will never get bored or feel that the characters are saying weird stuff. All the jokes are in place. Simply this movie is staying in my memory forever. I am so happy I had the chance to watch it in Cinema and I think I will go watch it again. I recommend it to everyone and believe me your mind will be blown. 2 advice I want to tell you: The first is ;if possible; go to the movie without watching the trailer and without reading the plot. This really quadrupled the fun for me. The second is do not go to the movie if your mind is occupied or distorted cause you may miss a part in the movie that is essential to the whole movie.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Other similar movies come to mind, specially the 1997 Sci-Fi, Contact. That movie was so scientifically accurate, it should be used as a benchmark for all similar movies.

30 November 2021,eyalron-72575,10," One of the greatest movies of all time
","""Interstellar"" is a definite masterpiece, yet, many viewers fail to see this obvious truth. The reason, I believe, is the dual-natured story: Both a scientific, highly cerebral aspect, dealing in the realities and implications of general relativity at the extremes of gravitational fields, and a highly emotional, humane storyline, emphasizing love, the connection between people that differentiates us from computers, machines and purely logical beings, which ultimately turns out to be the path for salvation for the hero and humanity as a whole. It seems that many people can relate to either of these aspects of the story, but not both in the same movie. Some viewers appreciate the cold science fiction portion, and once the more emotion driven ideas are introduced, lose their s#&t, in addition to some having an almost religious adherence to what they perceive as ""hard science"", having issues with ""scientific inaccuracies"", leading to a second s#&t losing event with the final black hole interior scene (which is a fascinating creative choice, it's a movie and not a science textbook after all, as well as being potentially scientifically possible in a 5 dimensional universe, as the movie suggests ours actually is). Others don't understand the fairly advanced scientific ideas and can't relate to what they perceive as a somewhat incomprehensible chain of events. However, for those viewers who can appreciate the scientific, the imaginative and the humane aspects of the movie at once, this is an experience that stimulates your intellect, awakens you imagination and touches your heart like practically no other movie can. Add to that unbelievable visual appeal, deep philosophical ideas about what makes one human, a fantastic score and the highly satisfying Nolan feel, and what you get is a truly unique, epic and highly moving cinematic experience.

It may have some loopholes but it combines many ideas from some of my favorite sci-fi thriller's:Prometheus, Contact, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, Aliens..etc It was thought provoking and included some great twists! One idea that stuck in my head was that ""Mankind wasn't meant to die on earth."" We had to learn our lesson the hard way,through one of our biggest mistakes, which is to me the really only way humans can learn. Could we have saved Earth at an earlier point in time?...maybe but I believe we would have only delayed the inevitable and those of you who didn't like the ""Love notion""...I believe that love can cross all boundaries of time and space.

Matthew McConaughey takes the film to a completely different, emotional level. Genre. Cross the event horizon of a black hole, remaining unharmed; to get from a three-dimensional space to a five-dimensional one, where reality (!) is represented by the room of the farmer's daughter, Cooper (the idea already claims to be a spiritual rather than a scientific world); to control objects from the past that reproduce themselves in the future (the idea already claims to be a time paradox); to save humanity by transmitting gravitational data explaining the connection between gravity and quantum mechanics in just a FEW lines of Morse code. All of the above is an indisputable fact that the film is purely artistic. None of the above things can theoretically happen (even the excuse ""they"" will not be able to justify such a thing).

Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA pilot and widower, looks longingly at the corn and raises children, a smart daughter (Foy) and an average son.

","This film was a big step in Christopher's Nolan cinematography level standard. All acts of the the film kept up a good pace, Although, I might have been uninterested in some sequences of the plot. Firstly, I was not really into the movie the first 20 minutes, it wasn't a really an attention grabber at first, intel they got more involved with space and other planets; that's where it really took off and grabbed my attention. I loved the different planet concepts and it's analogy and ideology of the time zones on different planets. Finally, when the third act of its plot execution came in, I felt that they had left some plot holes and confusing questions that needed to be ask; especially the whole dilemma with the main character behind the book case of his home. Overall, the film kept up a good pace with the plot and its cinematography, it is definitely one of Christopher Nolan's best work of film, definitely an 8/10.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Here I am, reviewing one of the most compelling movies in recent times ""The Interstellar"". They say, in order to master a craft you need to get at it and play it yourself. Christopher Nolan got it bang on. The idea of correlating physics with phenomenon spells wonders. (ain't a work of a novice) The movie may well be a humdrum for people who don't take interest in science but the way correlation has been depicted evokes interest even for a layman. Cooper & Murphy share a bond that epitomizes father daughter relationship. A belief that her dad will come back from a space odyssey, defying the reality, achieving what has not been dreamt of till date, Murphy patiently awaits the fulfillment of a promise made to her by her dad. The movie revolves around 4 physicists on a space exploration mission by NASA for discovering habitable planets by crossing a wormhole. (jargons are unintended) The concepts pertaining to time, gravity may appear to be supernatural & non existent but then they are backed by theories and postulates. The movie also portrays what goes on in an astronaut's life when he /she is away on a mission. Back on Earth, when Cooper's children send across videos to him about the latest developments, the joy of watching them and the agony of being away from them somehow reflects on the intricacies of emotions that have been masterfully enacted by Matthew McConaughey. To see them ageing gracefully pleases Cooper only to know that the activities are to be carried out within a specific time frame and that any delay could cost mankind thousands of years. All in all, a riveting movie, fantabulous instrumentals (Hans Zimmer is a master at it) and an excellent screenplay, Interstellar is a must watch!!!",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","I wonder about the number of decisions that
go into making a movie as epic and complex as Interstellar. I cannot even imagine how many choices have to be made about the script, the cast, the special effects, the editing, the score, and countless behind the scenes moves. So I understand that you cannot get every decision right. But who OK'd giving Anne Hathaway the exact same haircut as Adolph Hitler? Interstellar is an admirable movie: smart, ambitious, innovative, with a compelling story, believable leading performances, and incredible special effects. But every time Herr Hathaway was on-screen (and she is the second lead), I was worried she was going to use the rifts in space-time to zip back to 1939 and invade Poland.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Immerse yourself in this movie that takes place in the endless unknown-like space. You can get confused at any time in the movie and may have an emotional breakdown. Discovering new things with the scenes in the movie will force your imagination and make you say ""what a movie it was"" after the movie ends.

19 June 2018,codghost-86132,9," A Simple review
","Interstellar was an amazing experience. The story was sub-par at best, it was nothing great. A father leaves his home for the greater good, his daughter hates him for it- until she doesn't. The father faces many dangers and conflicts both internal and external on his journey, and his daughter still hates him- but is good at math. The father gets lost to time and ends up younger than his daughter(he did not get younger, she got older) and the daughter loathes him for not returning. As one can see the plot of the film carries no weight, no feeling, no magic. The magic, rather, resides in the scientific aspect of the movie. Most things that happen in the movie regarding gravity or space in general are all mathematical possibilities. Though there are false facts in the movie (for example: ice-clouds) there are many ideas shown in the movie that science claims true. The possibility of wormholes existing in space, the flow of time being altered by gravity, or even the claim that gravity is a force that can travel between dimensions so that an existence in the fifth dimension can communicate with one in the third dimension in all scientifically possible. We have the math to prove it. That is where this movie shines its brightest, it presents and explains (somewhat) these possible theories to people who may have never heard of them. This is what makes Interstellar such an amazing experience.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Outstanding image and sound atmosphere! Well performed by the lead actors. The subject is very carefully constructed it keeps you interested all the time. Surreal landscapes for sci-fi lovers. I noticed a new technique that attracted my attention: loud sounds followed by total sudden silence with exceptional imaging to make you focus on watching the screen undisturbed by other stimuli this way you wont loose the detail that the director wanted you to capture, very original for the visual and audio part. Interstelar is pure art of the sci-fi genre, a priceless gem in an ocean of cinematic junk that overflows in the present.

It is interesting because the theories that it raises are, that is to say, the relativity, the trips in the time and space, black holes ... they are interesting topics, but the movie is a chestnut look at her where you look at her, and we go, to compare it with 2001.... First, the reasons that provoke that the earth dying are not not clear at all and in addition slightly credible. If the human being was living in an apocalyptic world as raised serious a chaos, a total anarchy, without army, without controls, says the protagonist at any one time that pays many taxes,, But who is the one who would pay taxes in a doomed world to disappearing? Secondly and shoking mas of the movie, proves that Coop finds the secret base of nothing and they decide immediately that is he the chosen one to carry out the mission that they take preparing more of a decade, without training, without preparation, nothing. Perhaps did not they have anybody prepared to command this mission? Had not they trained anybody? There was no one in the whole planet another astronaut whom to offer the mission without having to hope that Mathew was finding them? I do not want to reveal any more details but the argument seems to me to be very sluggish and very pretentious. It is possible to summarize in a phrase and it, coming from Nolan, cannot split, we were waiting much more. If this movie had been directed by the less expert, unknown director, So good, one more movie, but having signed Nolan, it is not possible to be benevolent, it was giving for more.

8 January 2015,adriaanmeticloud,10," Separating the educated
","This movie is excellent,and there are a couple of reasons why. To start off, the bond between Cooper and Murph is beautifully portrayed. I know that sounds kind of cliché because everyone is mentioning it, but u got to admit that the scene where Cooper watched Murph become his age was really heartbreaking. Furthermore there are a few plot points that were remarkable. Mann throwing Cooper of the clip was a really pleasant surprise, and a moment that stuck me to my seat. Also the 5-dimensional world was something rather unexpected, and that is where this movie stands out. The music (once again) was absolutely mind blowing and really fit Interstellar, considering they were most of the time traveling in space. Indeed, she got its flaws (Music perhaps not synchronized well with dialog, unrealistic scenarios)but that are just minor issues. After all, the docking scene was truly fascinating, and the level of scientific accuracy is what makes this movie interesting. The way art, science, drama and creativity are combined in this movie is what makes it a unique and mind blowing experience. The more effort u put into understanding the plot, the more satisfaction u gain from this movie, and that is what most people seem to forget. The more i seem to understand the movie and it's scientific aspects, the more pleasure i get in seeing people confused. This movie separates the educated from the less educated and the interested from the less interested. Interstellar is a successful Christofer Nolan movie and one I will not forget in my life. I can't wait to watch it again.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","What can you say about a film that Christopher Nolan co-wrote and helmed? You can only say that it was fantastic, another masterpiece from one of Hollywood's most well-known modern filmmakers. But there is much more to Christopher Nolan's most recent film, ""Interstellar,"" than what first appears. The point I want to make is that it has elevated the connection between science and fiction to a completely new level, despite the fact that it is a superbly planned and executed film with an amazing cast that includes Academy Award winners.

I truly understand that not everything in this genre should be analysed according to realistic measures but it was a bit too much for me. I can't write what exactly I have in mind, I don't want to spoil it to you, but be warned. The ending in my opinion doesn't match the rest of the movie. I don't mind watching movies where time isn't necessary a constant factor (eg. TimeCop), but I think it would be better to keep it linear to the end, not change it at the last 15 minutes.

The movie is definitely an eye-full for the audience, with the lengthy transitions/cuts of jaw dropping views.

One only needs to remember Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception and now Interstellar. There will always be a debate after a movie like Interstellar if this is the best one from Nolan ever or was it Inception. Personally I feel that Inception was pretty remarkable.

","I saw this movie the Friday it came out. Since it was close to three hours long, I went to a dine-in theater. I suspected it would be good, but I walked out of that theater amazed. Where to begin. I suppose at the end, because that is what I remember the best. It felt like it was a tad bit rushed, probably due to Nolan not wanting to make it even longer than it was. However, it still ended well and was very thought-provoking. The one thing that made me mad was how they killed off basically every astronaut besides the two main ones. It seems like those are the only people who survive in these kinds of movies now. (Granted that, I can't seem to think of a movie that managed to weave the end-of-the-world storyline like this one). I didn't even know Matt Damon was going to be in the movie, which was a pleasant surprise, until he killed another astronaut, tried to kill Cooper (McConaughey), and ended up killing himself trying to dock. Yea, he did that. Anyway, the exposition also was one of the best parts, I think. It showed what the Earth was like now, set up the characters, and provided some good humorous parts (the whole parent-teacher conference thing). The visual effects were amazing, the sound was okay (but everything else makes up for it), and the acting was also very good. I personally like Doyle, but I saw his death coming (he had ""red shirt"" written all over him. The last thing I want to say is I like how they incorporated the whole black-hole scene. For a minute or so I thought it had went completely supernatural, which disappointed me, until I realized what was really going on and I now consider it probably one of the best scenes in the movie.

","First things first. I loved Interstellar. Another of Nolan's films, The Dark Knight Rises, has been my favorite movie for a long time, but it took a couple of viewings to decide on that. I've seen Interstellar once and it has pushed The Dark Knight Rises to a close second. Interstellar is cinematic genius at its finest, incorporating intricate story telling that kept me hooked the entire time. In my opinion, this film was even more well thought out and thought provoking than other films that Christopher Nolan has done such as Inception and The Prestige, and I loved both of those movies. There have been very few films that I've given a ten star review to, whether it's because I didn't like the movie or I felt it lacked in some areas. When I give a ten star review, it is because I feel that I've found a movie that has been made to more than perfection, and that is what I thought of Interstellar. When I watch a movie I make it a point to look for errors because I like finding them, and I found no memorable ones in Interstellar. It's a perfect blend of intense, Adventure, and, in my opinion, thriller. And the fact that Space movies are some of my favorites just further helped in my decision that this is my favorite film to date.

It's not like they would evolve into the 5-D beings. More likely they'd end up sh*tting up some other planet in the solar system. It seems the 5-D beings evolved way beyond what we were able to accomplish, either through different forces at work on a different planet or just being taught by Anne Hathaway's character what to do from the get go so as not to repeat the sh*t world she came from or a combination of both or some other phenomena. Imagine if there was some being that raised the first humans on this planet to be kind, loving and taught advanced science, math, language, etc. instead of the constant warring, killing and enslaving that has gone on since the dawn of man, mostly to appease the gluttony of one person in command in the pursuit of power and riches.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

21 November 2014,elliottjones1,10," Nolan hits the nail on the head, a masterpiece.
","Having waited for several months for the release of Interstellar, and being excited by many of the factors revealed before the release, i.e. McConaughey starring, Nolan directing, and of course Hans Zimmer again composing the score. There were so many different things to be excited about, and whilst many people have been disappointed by Interstellar, I think Nolan has created perhaps his best achievement to date. There is not a single aspect of Interstellar that I can describe as less then amazing. In fact, I think it even eclipses the Dark Knight; despite a truly spellbinding performance like Heath Ledger, I felt that the star- studded cast put on nothing less than a truly emotional, captivating performance. McConaughey put in another brilliant performance that have we have become more recently acquainted with, Anne Hathaway again provides a strong supporting performance along with Jessica Chastain/ Mackenzie Foy as Murph. The most surprising however was Matt Damon's brief appearance; his character provided a strong antagonist basis in a fell that was already so emotional, and Nolan really captured the feelings of a human at his lowest point. Again there has to be a huge amount of credit given to Hans Zimmer, who again created a fantastic score for a film that was rounded off perfectly with the use and sometimes disuse of sound. The score perfectly captured the emotional backdrop of the film and the silence in space created a perfect surrounding and allowed the audience to immerse itself in the film more deeply. The ending in itself actually rounds the film off perfectly, and without any spoilers, actually made total sense and despite criticism, I think Nolan has rounded off his masterpiece perfectly. Overall, this in my opinion is one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever created, and the whole film is truly brilliant, with great filming, scenery, acting, music and a perfect storyline based on the works of the genius that is Kip Thorne.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Matthew McConnaughey is terrific and the rest of the cast is at least good. My one complaint is the music by Hans Zimmer - can't we have a melody just once? Lots of big orchestral chords and a couple of nice solo piano moments, but this film just cries out for a big theme that we can leave the theater remembering. Gigantic missed opportunity - think of Indiana Jones without the Raiders March or Star Wars with no big melodies.

In this scenario, Cooper, who is a former pilot, works now as a farmer, but he and his daughter Murphy receive strange signals which led them to a secret space base.

","Interstellar delivers a wonderful array of pictures in space, persuasive accounts and visual interpretations of the workings of physics and impressive special effects. However, it lacks what could be described as the essential core of a great movie: a convincing plot. What starts off as dystopian, humanist warning against our current way of life, is continuously deranged into a melodramatic, hollow and corny love-story. The dualism between Cooper and Brand is relegated to a one-sided, macho-dominated relationship, reminiscent of old Classic Hollywood, where the road-cruisers or horses are replaced with a spaceship. Also, if love is the only thing that transcends time and space, then the Nolan brothers have apparently run out of ideas, trying to emulate the brilliance and depth of other space sagas like Space Odyssey. Introducing love as the story 's fundament is simply skewed, given the very serious account in the first third/half of the movie. If this were to be a serious or daring movie (and maybe if film executives had less influence over the story?), than it had to offer either an open ending, or the opposite of what is being portrayed: Human use of technology ultimately responsible for global troubles, rather than an infinite source of salvation.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

2 March 2015,moluz,8," How our mind interacts with time passing
","In Nolan's last film, Interstellar, time dilates under certain conditions. And here is preserved episodic presentation, only in a much more elegant and complex way. This type of presentation, ideological and conceptual evolution over time, starts with the movie Memento (in order of appearance speaking), where time stops, the main character remains locked in a period of his life, repeated indefinitely, he has a disease that doesn't allows the brain to create new memories. So in terms of time this man remained in a position to find the killer of his wife until his life comes to an end. But other possibilities arise, contraction of time, in which we live a life within hours, which demonstrates the fact that everything happens only in our mind, everything is controlled by our brain, dreams, imagination and reality are in fact parallel worlds. The phenomenon of contraction is presented in Inception. And number three in that situation when time dilates, which in a few years you live just a few hours, presented in Interstellar. The film is giving a mathematical explanation, where the phenomenon is closely related to space and time, in other words speed, which in turn is influenced by many other phenomena. But these things are all essentially something that is limited to the perception of the human brain's perception of time and space. Speaking conceptual these three films complete themselves and Interstellar closes the circle. Being the newest, probably most expensive it has the best effects and it's achieved extraordinarily well. In this film I do not think you can get bored, even if you do not understand, the images keep you there amazed, you want to see more. Therefore these movies forms a trilogy, no visible connection between them and no specific order to be viewed. There are connected only by the same director's mind and the concept of time. Each one is a time mirror in which we look at times, but united there are our ability to think, our extraordinary complex brains, but at the same time extremely simple, figuratively speaking.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interstellar always looked a sure shot, from the moment it was announced that it will be Christopher Nolan's next project. And it didn't disappoint! In fact it exceeded my personal expectations for the film. Christopher Nolan has always been criticised for being cold hearted and lacking the human touch in his films. But then again he is not one of those directors who relies on emotional stuff in his films, he is a visionary director who compromise those shortcomings with his grand innovative ideas he put in to his scripts. He always does. Although Interstellar is not the greatest of emotional stuff ever made, it does answer many of the criticism Nolan has had in the past for being cold hearted and Interstellar is undoubtedly the film that has the most human touch to it among Nolan's works. The script as usual, did its magic and that combined with its brilliant score from Hans Zimmer and the stunning visuals, captured in Imax 65mm on hateful and physically challenging locations, which was then converted and projected in to 70mm (something only very handful of directors are willing to do, not to mention Nolan never used the green screens too!), Interstellar takes us on a mesmerizing and never seen journey in to the unknowns.

This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. I can't wait to see what he does next, but i'm not sure it will be as emotionally powerful as Interstellar. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.

The movie caught me in its first scenes where you see a retired NASA pilot,Cooper (Matt McConaughey) is chasing and controlling a misguided Indian drone ;a midst his corn field..The interest of a scientific enthusiast has been interestingly enacted by McConaughey(truly an Oscar winning performance..) The film grows in the scientific basis ,where in a series of very beautiful viewing experience has been perfected by C&J Nolan . T.A.R.S..wormholes..interstellar travel..time dilation..exploration..C.A.S.E...blackholes..singularity...everything was there (really great work) The last 20 minutes of the movie was something the world had never experienced(of course a matter of great scientific importance and a topic that scientists have been debating over the years).The director takes us to a 5-D space ; shot in 2D (the film is 2D; but the screen tend to be small ;should've be experienced in imax).Finally the movie plants an idea to research upon in the minds of growing scientists.. It gave real goosebumps as any other Nolan movie.. The movie not only focuses on the scientific aspects but gives great importance to human values.// The deep relationship between a father and daughter has been beautifully pictured (in fact really cried towards the end).Another heart touching movie...with really meaningful quoted dialogs. The background score by Hans Zimmer has to really appreciated; really rises our emotions...great script and dialogs.. no comments on behind the screen work ! Though there was a little difficulty in understanding the slang used by the actor in the film ; subtitles did the work ../ A real great piece of artistic excellence , beautifully crafted , which gives you emotional goosebumps..and the hangover is never ending.....a must watch for science enthusiasts...",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

It is worth the journey to see what Nolan has constructed as a model of the unknowable. Interstellar may be a preposterous epic, but it is an epic nonetheless. Watching this movie in a Theater was an amazing experience for me. Well done Nolan and Mathew, movie was awesome.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Ust saw Interstellar and it was epic tale of humanity's struggle to survive a dying planet. Visually breath-taking, the vastness of space and smallness of man is evident. You feel alone at times but not necessarily afraid. The dialog is near-perfect with but does degrade into sentimentality at times. If only it was as subtle as the humour which was spot on. For whatever reason, I found the movie had a similar vibe at times to Prometheus and the first Star Trek movie. Again, I think that the linkage is the coldness and vastness of space. And the fragility of man. From a science point of view there were pleasing aspects explored such as time dilation which I've never seen treated so openly in film.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
21 December 2014,hunggarchristian,10," This is amazing. If you enjoy sci-fi or good film you will be in awe.
","Well first let me start by saying that this movie has my favorite director direct in this masterpiece, but I don't care who it is I try to remain fair, in reviewing things. With that said... This movie is amazing. I went in expecting phenomenal things, but what I got blew my mind. Let's start with the acting: The Acting is amazing. Everyone does their parts perfectly. Matthew McConaughey, as the main character is phenomenal in this. His raw embodiment of the character is part of what drives the movie. But that's what makes this movie so brilliant. There is no one person stealing the show. Everyone is treated as their own, and are perfect to contributing to the piece. Granted McConaughey as was said is brilliant, Anne Hatheway, and Mackenzie Foy were also phenomenal. Jessica Chastain was great. The entire crew, and everyone especially Michael Caine was phenomenal. It was very emotional, but in that I think it connected with us as humans more than any other Nolan movie has. The visuals are out of this world. (Get it HAHA) Anyway... It sucked me in as far as black hole take you. I was leaning off of my seat, as well as my Dad, and my Mom was too. This piece is perhaps his best complete movie, as everything is phenomenal. ( I know I keep saying that, but I just can't describe it any other way.) The score by Hans Zimmer, perfect for the movie. Every scene was fed angst, and anxiety, or sadness, or triumph as the notes flowed into my ears. I saw someone mention how it cut from the scene where he says goodbye to liftoff in a countdown. That choice made you feel it immediately, how slow time must have passed from the house to the spaceship. You know Christopher Nolan is known for posing philosophical questions through simply showing the movie, and this really makes you think about who, and what we are. What we are capable of, and most importantly what makes us human. Love transcends time, space, and gravity. It is the only things that binds all of us together. It doesn't matter how far we go, we are only getting further from where we started in distance, not in what isn't tangible. As we drift along in space with the crew, we see how everything around us is relative, how perhaps we contact ourselves in some other form. All of these questions are some that can be quantified in a single sentence, some require more than a lifetime to truly understand. So all in all, this movie takes you on an amazing journey to the unknown and back. It makes you feel patriotic, determined, scared, amazed, fearful, and triumphant, all in 3 hours. I know the length might be considered by some to be a bit long, but it didn't feel long at all. Every single moment was meant to be, not a moment wasted. I actually wanted it to keep going. So if you like sci-fi, you love it. If you like drama you'll love it, if you like love, you'll love it, if you like adventure you'll love it. Go in expecting something great, but don't try to define it, because you can't. It is so simple yet so complex. I left the theater in awe. Everything, and every scene left me in awe. I am still trying to fathom everything that my eyes just witnessed. What is farthest away brings us all closer together. 10/10",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

In a large way, it makes sense that a revered yet ultimately commercial filmmaker like Christopher Nolan would want to expand upon the pure majesty of 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, 2001's greatness lies in its trademark ambiguity and detachment. Interstellar finds Christopher Nolan, rather uncomfortably, stuck between Hollywood, Blockbuster ""fame and glory"" and trailblazing artistic merit. While Inception, his masterpiece, showcased Nolan juggling action and art, Interstellar bites off a little more than it can chew.

","Christopher Nolan is, without a doubt, one of the best directors working today. His films are almost perfect, but there are clearly ups and downs in his filmography. But the essential issue that promotes him as an artist is his almost extreme dedication to a notion of creativity and respect for the audience. He does not just want to tell a story about the world of mixed dreams, he wants us to be emotionally invested so that we finally understand that the essential core in any movie will always fall back on the emotional aspect, or rather, on our ability to re- positively or negatively) on the characters that fill the screen.
The film of this master of the 21st Century is called ""Interstellar"" and I say that it is a risky film and that, in general, it succeeds in its difficult task.
It is undoubtedly one of the films of that year, the making and photography are particularly studied in this film when absolutely everything, from the first minute, seems realistic and without CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery). The soundtrack is, at this time, a seal of Nolan in all its films and this one does not disappoint in anything, accompanies the film as if of an opera it was, with the crescendos to be intense and sweeping and the scenes more tense to leave someone breathless due to subtle touches. Interpretations are, as a general rule, very good. Regarding the story, it is difficult to go into detail without revealing much of the narrative so I will conclude by saying that this is one of the best films of that year.
However Nolan revealing that thematically has no limits and that his vision is more a gift for those who love cinema intensely.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The way everything that was happening was explained, I was able to understand what they were doing.

Astronomy always fascinated me, but I'm afraid I'm not smart enough to understand the physics of astronomy.

It stands THE-BEST at every element - Characterization, science, logic, a view, story, screenplay, visual effect, audiography and so on, every element of the movie needs a mention.

This movie deals with the Einstein's Theory of Relativity and this is one of the mysterious points of the movie, that most of the viewers didn't get thru it! Background music needs a mention here. Nolan takes the advantage of music in penetrating the viewers into the movie. Interstellar sits at the top of his stack of BGMs. He may win an Oscar or not, it never matters.

Sure. - All of this while driving full speed straight through a corn field, without the slightest bump. Sure. - The wind blows some dust into a room. Hero stares at is, understands it is a binary code of the coordinates of a top secret Nasa base. - Upon entering the base, he meets the beautiful and smart daughter of the professor. Of course that becomes the predictable love affair, but of course she is first difficult to get and of course the hero first has to save her life at least once. - They blow up half of their space station with an enormous explosion, but no problem, just continue flying with the other half. - Earth needs to manipulate gravity to save humanity. No problem, just fly through a black hole and you will automatically gain any knowledge needed. - But wait, they still have to transfer that knowledge to Earth. The only way to do that is to have the hands of an old watch sway up and down in a Morse code because that watch has a love connection to hero's daughter.

It is the search for the definition of humanity – what it means to be human, what we are capable of doing and what our place and purpose is in the vast universe.

It features characters shoveling exposition at each other for almost three hours, and a few of those characters have no character to speak of: they're mouthpieces for techno-babble and philosophical debate. And for all of the director's activism on behalf of shooting on film, the tactile beauty of the movie's 35mm and 65mm textures isn't matched by a sense of composition. The camera rarely tells the story in Nolan's movies.

The only reason to leave the Solar System and start to branch out across the Milky Way would be fear of roving black holes, or stars. Other than roving black holes and stars we have a home in the Solar System for the next 2 billion years at the least. It is estimated that at the current rate of growth it will take 500 years to reach the first trillion humans/cyborgs. Let's say we spread to the nearest 10 solar systems. Those solar systems will not need habitable planets. We will manufacture habitat enough to house a quadrillion humans/cyborgs around each star.

","Nice movie. Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine. The film features a crew of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for humanity. Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which has its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007. Christopher Nolan produced the film with his wife Emma Thomas through their production company Syncopy and with Lynda Obst through Lynda Obst Productions. Caltech theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, whose work inspired the film, was an executive producer and acted as scientific consultant. Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and Legendary Pictures co-financed the film.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

22 August 2016,ryanboluyt,7," Good, but didn't quite meet my expectations
","I tried to keep my expectations realistic for this movie. And the movie was certainly quite good and very visually gratifying. However, as a Nolan fan I was left a bit disappointed. Inception and Dark Knight are some of my favorite movies of all time. Prestige, Insomnia, and memento are also great flicks as is the entire dark night trilogy. But while those movies were more well-rounded, (bringing elements of intrigue, fascination, humor, action, great characters, twists, etc.), this movie left me wanting more. It had wonderful potential. Early on I was hoping the pace would pick up some, which it did, but even though things were moving slowly I was still interested in what was happening on screen. Unfortunately, other than McConaughey and Hathaway, there weren't really any characters I cared about. I suppose if you are mostly interested in seeing some really fantastic footage of space and planets and hearing a little physics talk then this could be a great movie for you. There were certainly some bright moments that were full of suspense and wonder. The soundtrack also played great. But there was the potential to do much more here and at a faster pace. Some great actors were in the movie, but the early scenes really didn't do a lot to make the audience feel connected or even like many of the characters. Also, I understand not all movies can be rainbows and puppy dogs, but the movie was a bit bleak and depressing. Heck, the funniest lines came from the robots of all places! They certainly could have used more humor and smiles from the actors interspersed throughout the movie. Also, the dialogue was a bit tricky to hear at times and somewhat difficult to understand as well. Another problem was that the explanations of what was happening didn't make a lot of sense. Scifi movies will obviously have some aspects that are far fetched, but the movie followed widely accepted theories quite a bit and then all of a sudden there was a very odd, uninteresting final scene explaining how gravity was being used to transcend time for communication. Like how in the world did he end up in this strange 3D chamber containing countless doors to the past through the old bookshelf through which he communicated with Murph? And if humans built this, why couldn't they devise a way to communicate further back in time to warn everyone to treat the earth better or it would be depleted soon. Kind of strange how he didn't even ask about his son when he woke up too. I assume he was dead since he was older than Murph and had lung damage but you'd think a father would at least say ""hey what's Tom's status? dead or alive?"". It's nice to see that McConaughey survived and all and got to see Murph briefly but a better ending in my opinion would have involved him getting back home to a time when the kids were still young so he could be a part of their lives. I mean I'm no astrophysicist but if time is a dimension and it can move faster in a forward direction for one location relative to another, then it stands to reason that time could move in reverse, just as an object moves from one x coordinate to another and back again, for that one location, while moving in reverse at a much slower rate in the other. If they could have stumbled on some weird black hole like body of matter that's more like an anti-black hole then this could have been accomplished. And although it might have been a bit of a stretch, its far less of a stretch than some of the other events that transpired closer to the ending. Another possible ending that wouldn't have been bad would have been if his kids were still alive, but a bit younger, perhaps in their 40s or 50s and maybe we would get to see a few scenes of McConaughey married to Hathaway with Murph and Tom and their families all spending a holiday together on the newly colonized planet. There are plenty of endings that would have given a bit more satisfaction and closure. All in all, cool to see but If I could communicate with the me from 3 hours ago I'd say don't expect a whole lot,its more of a visual masterpiece than anything else. Not enough story going on. I hope Nolan can get back to his former self for the next projects and create the kind of movies that leave me fully satisfied and thinking for days after.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This was spectacular! I mean... Wow. I'm a big fan of Nolan and his films and I was super excited for this to come out. This was one I was afraid would not live up to Nolan's recent films, especially because of the mixed reviews that I've seen. I'm very happy to say that this is so far my favorite movie this year; it's intriguing and completely mind-blowingly awesome! I have always been a big fan of space, and this really revealed it in the coolest way ever! Space is weird, but it's so awesome too! I loved this movie! I can see how some people may not be as big of a fan as I am though. It's super long; I mean 3 hours long with the commercials which is a lot of time. Plus, there is a ton of dialogue, all of which I actually found really interesting. However, this gives the movie a slower pace. There aren't any inappropriate parts, but there is a slightly hard to hear F-word. I have yet to see a movie anything like this. I also loved Hans Zimmer's score! Hearing the rumbling and loud organs was just plain epic! Acting was top notch too with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway giving a killer performance. Everyone really did do a solid job in acting. This is a definite must see; you'll be happy you saw it in a theater. Note: I'm not sure whether it was because of the theater I was in or the way the sound was mixed, but I could not hear some of the dialogue in a few of the parts!

Very confusing, and I would have ended it differently. But other than that, pretty good overall. I would probably see it again, if someone else wanted to go to it. It was very action packed, but I found that parts of it were not explained well enough, and others kind of left you hanging there for more. It was in parts, very sad.

It makes the best of this genre that is not always popular by a big audience because of its incredibility. Interstellar is incredible credible! The film has also a philosophic layer, but the 'lessons' are not obtrusive. The duration of the film gives an extra dimension to the film and seems part of the story. Where other present day films are too long, Interstellar is just good in terms of duration. So go to the theaters, because such a film earns a public.

","Since a lot of critics and scientists have unleashed themselves upon tearing down of Christopher Nolan's ""INTERSTELLAR"", communicating their opinion merely in the realm of right and wrong, which always includes a lot of comparison and separation, I would like to grasp this opportunity to point out that this film's mainly focus is on the non-linear reality, which does not include the seemingly never-ending talk of right and wrong majority of humans on this planet spend their entire lives either speaking about or listening to, or both. Especially science has become a dimension of rigid, unsubstantiated claims, which reminds me of the way religious cults operate. Although everyone is entitled to own opinion, personally I find this film extraordinary and brilliant. The main theme of this film is the power of love, which clearly never submits itself to the rules of right and wrong nor linear, rigid thinking. I guess those people who are unable to view with their heart, but are instead still stuck in their head, which dictates them of right and wrong, and denies the immense information provided to them via the waves of feeling, view the entire presentation in totally different manner.

This aspect made the movie's action even though, in my opinion, was not necessary. I was expecting a fight for achieving the goal against some external forces not against ourselves.

","That was the single most mind blowing beautiful, tragic, inspiring, hopeful anayltic concurrence of the human character in the face of the unknown, where environment and humanity are both what sustains and what breaks us to our very kneas, film of a generation. No every generation. I can't even express this without my positive analytical comments making me feel I am doing the film a severe injustice, it's better than words. The whole audience and I in the cinema were caught in the captive imagination of Christoper Nolan's emersive story telling. The cinematography set a new standard, the acting was natrual, the plot was incredible. We cried, we laughed, we jumped in shock, we were pinned to our seats. It tugged every heart string. It has really inspired me to look into the current space science and begin to look up at the sky again as I had done as a little boy.

","'Interstellar' was incredible. The visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while. Most of the critic reviews have said that some bits are a little too unbelievable, but I have to disagree. Yes, there were some parts that were definitely in the ""fi"" part of sci-. But the thing is, 'Interstellar' deals with concepts that we know very little about. We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie, which I personally think is Nolan's most beautiful film to date.

","Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's most ambitious and emotional works ever. And it is a very grand sci fi adventure which was all about a father's love for his daughter. It did have some noticeable plot holes and a questionable third act but it does not mean it's a well made movie. It is not Mr Nolan's finest efforts. He had Inception, The Dark Knight and Memento but it is just great. It is eye catching, tear jerking, exhilarating,engaging and a beautifully made movie. It had a very great cast with Matthew McConaughey doing a stellar job along with the beautiful and thrilling music by the legendary Hans Zimmer it makes it one of the greatest experiences in a theater. What I don't get is: why do some people hate this movie?? I mean it is a well directed, well written movie with the greatest visuals ever and exhilarating music. I mean it does have some plot holes. It is logically questionable. But which movies aren't?? It is a movie set in the other side of the universe. The unknown. It is all about imagination! And in the end it is a work of fiction! And the reason people flock to watch Mr Nolan's movies are because they all have a stellar cast, very well made, engaging and always has something unusual and unexpected.

17 November 2014,gpuertolas,8," Good but not Great
","I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's movies and I was especially excited to see Interstellar. However, when the almost 3 hour space epic was done, I was not blown away. I found it to be a visually exciting film with excellent performances and suspenseful sequences but I left the theater with the feeling that something was missing. Interstellar is an almost great science fiction but it has too many elements, especially with the plot that just don't hold up with a little scrutiny. We are told that this is an earth sometime in the not too distant future that is dying and the reason has something to do with blight on the worlds food supply. Yet visually all we see are dust storms. We are told wheat is gone, yet there are several scenes of characters sitting on their porch drinking what looks like a beer. This made me wonder what they made the beer from. In other words it took me out of the film. In another scene as Matthew McConaughey's character is driving his kids to school a drone flies by overhead and he immediately whips out his laptop and some sort of device which enables him to take control of the drone. Really? Grant that it's the future, he is an engineer and an ex Nasa pilot, would he really be driving around with his drone catching equipment in the back of beat up pick up now that he's a farmer? The sequence is expertly put together and Nolan knows how to keep the audience engaged but it's a matter of style over substance without balancing the two. The next stretch comes when McConaughey and his daughter are caught breaking into the super top secret Nasa base, where it just so happens they are looking for a pilot to lead their next mission into space. I think we have all seen this one before. Granted, it is heart wrenching when McConaughey leaves his family and Nolan does a fine job of handling the space crews interactions. A wormhole has been discovered outside of Saturn's orbit and the Nasa scientists believe ""someone"" is trying to help us. However, no one especially considers the question. If you had the ability to create a wormhole to help the earth, why would you put it so far away? Perhaps these mystery E.T.s want us to earn it. We learn that a mission was mounted to the wormhole where 12 possible planets were detected and of the 12, 3 are possible new homes for the human race. Now unless those E.T.s are real jokers, why would they present us with 12 options, instead of just opening the other end of the wormhole to the best planet? None the less, McConaughey, leads his crew to the wormhole in sequences that are reminiscent of 2001:A Space Odyssey. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. But, unlike Kubrick's film which has rock solid logic because of its ambiguity, by explaining too much Nolan removes the viewer from the experience. i don't want to describe the surprises that happen in the last third of the film but it ties together nicely right up till McConaughey enters a black hole. Without revealing too much the inevitable spaghettification which would occur to any matter entering a black hole never happens to Matt (Although his spaceship breaks up.) It appears the E.T.s can do anything. Look, I know it may seem like I am trashing the movie but I hold Mr. Nolan to a higher standard and he falls short here. I really wanted to love it, I only liked it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","One thing that Nolan gets a bit wrong is the narrative. Nolan was never a 'warm' director, his films are filled with brilliant ideas and flair but it feels cold, it maybe suits Memento and The Dark Knight but in Interstellar he seems to have been lost in determining which of the interpersonal drama or the sci-fi that will be Interstellar's forte. The result is a rather incongruous script, intermittently cutting off the excitement of the previous scene and so on. But it is a forgivable sin, for the good is a lot more than the bad in this monumental film. At the end of the day, all I can say is that Interstellar is a grand film. It is monolithic, thoughtful, sentimental, sophisticated, visceral but also with its flaws. I wouldn't say it's Nolan's best work to date, but I daresay that this is one of the best science fiction ever released.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

During the movie we see an Earth turning to ruins from lack of rain, thus causing great dust storms. Thus causing the NASA to find a new planet for us to live on. That is all the summary i will give want to talk more about the details of this film. To start the music sequences in these films were phenomenal leaving you heart racing at times. Also the music said the moods for different scenes perfectly. Another part of the film i thoroughly enjoyed was the cuts and shots the director used. For example the cross cutting from Cooper to Brandt as elder Murph tells cooper that she made it. Also when of my favorite shot was the medium close up on Cooper as he saw the last video transmission from his son.

The story is pretty good and I like the father/daughter relationship being highlighted but it is at the expense of the son who I feel is not really needed and is used as an afterthought. Nolan seems to be telling us that space travel is important even though we don't commit to it as much as we used to. I like that idea and I like the setup of the ""blight"" though I would prefer if they explain it more. The effects are good and the film is beautifully shot so you should watch it in theaters but the sound sometimes becomes Inaudible, I couldn't catch some key plot points at first because some lines were hard to hear.

We have no idea what the 4th or 5th dimension is like, or what it would be like to go through a wormhole or a black hole. I don't think it's fair to call something unbelievable, when we have absolutely no idea what WOULD be believable in those circumstances. Either way, excellent writing from the Nolan brothers. The visuals were outstanding, and will no doubt be nominated for an Oscar. The performances were excellent, though nothing Oscar worthy, as is the case with most of Nolan's films ('The Dark Knight' being the obvious exception). Hans Zimmer's score was amazing and blended perfectly with the film. All in all, 'Interstellar' is an excellent movie"" Beautiful journey in every way, I enjoyed it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

The acting, too, was superb by all the great stars that played in this film. No complaints from me there, and even the much debated scientific arena that this sci-fi movie plays in was very accurate, especially considering that most of them are theories, and to top it off this is a movie, so of course the directer will make some professional leeway to fit his needs.

14 January 2016,maxwellswell-202-33398,10," If you love science at all, its totally worth your time
","First off, I love any movie that involves science. If you also love science, give this a shot. I was pretty excited to see this movie and usually when I get excited to see a movie, I get let down. So as a rule of thumb I try not to hype up a movie because of shear excitement. For this movie, it does not matter. I am not a big Matthew Mc fan at all but he delivered a fantastic performance as a father of 2 who used to work with a space program. I will not give any details away but the entire movie is about the earth and its resources dwindling. So, scientist must send people out into space to find a planet more sustainable. In the mean time he discovers what it truly feels like experiencing Einsteins theory of relativity. Now this concept is hard to grasp onto because everything we have ever been taught about logic seems to be thrown out the window so I suggest everyone read up on it a little bit to help better understand the concept so its simpler to follow along. After the story and problems keep unfolding, he finds himself distraught by the thought of his absence on earth with his children. This is where it gets tricky, this is where the 4th dimension comes into play...TIME. Time plays a HUGE factor into this movie and trying to preserve/slow it so he can return to earth before its too late. I will stop here because I don't want to slip up and give anything away. If you are in the mood for a solid film and are ready to sit and pay attention for an extended period of time, I highly suggest this movie. If this movie does not seem to fit your criteria of what you believe to be a good movie, I wouldn't spend the time. The cinematography is excellent, the directing is on point and the visual effects and colors are brilliant. Everything I could have hoped for in a Sci-Fi.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","It's an old story retold. Humanity is in need of a Savior, so one of our own rises to the challenge leaving home and hearth to face the great unknown. In the tradition of Ulysses, Coop, ventures into space, ultimately to become a new Adam. On one level this is a fun ride across the universe. On another, it is the North American dream all over again. Conquer, control and consume land and resources to the point of exhaustion and then move on. Environmentalists won't find much comfort here. Neither will farmers appreciate the message. Vocationally, they are required, but undervalued. Mere managers, the true heroes are like biblical Cain, wanderers intent on building a name for themselves. The other tired conviction re-spun is how education is still, somehow, the answer. The Nolan's lead us into temptation with the seemingly Divine ""they,"" who are ultimately revealed as an evolved ""us."" A leap of faith larger than any religion has ever posited, but sci-fi writers are keen to offer it as a distraction to the problems at hand. Admittedly, Matthew McConaughey's character seems to know other things will remain the same. The evil ""out there"" will be ""the evil we bring to it."" Liar Dr. Brandt and the slightly deranged Dr. Mann proves his point. However, to be fair, they do get one thing right: love does transcend time and space.

Even if see it twice or many times, we will always see something new, something that we haven't acknowledge before. It's like that the film is unraveling itself. The way the film is shot is great.

","Unquestionably my favorite movie, due to its perfection on every cinematographic aspect. As an amazing film is always surprising for its plot twist, this might be the best example for those who seek a bright masterpiece of fiction, known as ""Interstellar"". This jewel from Christopher Nolan, as most of his films, like Inception, The Dark Knight, Memento and a few more, have one thing in common, an unsolved puzzle that leads the audience to a questionable brainstorm, hence the struggle to reach a clear picture of how the whole plot is clockworked. Interstellar was a revolution of sci-fi, in fact, it had an astonishing impact in all generations of this genre of movie, fans. From the beginning until the end, due to its soundtrack and visual effects, the viewer becomes part of it. The soundtrack was simply breathtaking. Hans Zimmer, once again, proved his excellence by adapting the most suitable piece of music to each scene. The fact that the movie is set on an interstellar journey, this bandmaster thrilled the peak moments with a sensitive touch of an amazing orchestra fulfilling the audience with feelings of anxiety and suspense. A smart detail that can also be referred to this section of the movie is the silence for the space scenes. This touch of reality, knowing that no sound can propagate on that environment, resulted in a space travel sense turning the whole movie theatre into a dashing roller-coaster. Hans Zimmer is responsible for this unquestionable realization, that a soundtrack can change a whole movie. This can be described as coloring the atmosphere of every scene, resulting on the following Oscar nominations, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Best Achievement in Sound Mixing and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. On the visual effects sector, the viewer is intensely absorbed by the screen. A fulfilling darkness is implemented with dazzling visual effects achieving an almost perfect reality. Amongst the planetary system each millimeter is minutely detailed similarly as offering the audience a space travel ticket. Adding, an Oscar was won, Best Achievement in Visual Effects. Christopher Nolan kept with his precise cast choice. Matthew Mcconaughey proved once again that acting is his special skill. He got into the movie in such a way that a difference between reality and fiction became nonexistent. His dramatic expressions unblocked a feeling of sadness and victory touching people's hearts throughout the movie. Supporting role actors like Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy gave birth to mystique between them along the entire movie. Lastly, on the Plot (Narrative) section, a perfect completion can be found. Nolan, not just created a plot twist at the end but also adapted a physical and logical paradox. Its philosophical taste aroused an addiction of further thinking of how our universe is composed. The fact that the director made Kip Thorne an important element for all the scientific proofs for the movie in order to give the audience the most attainable sense of credibility throughout the plot. This was a never seen before film revolutionizing the sci-fi way of thinking and beliefs.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","The movie Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolen, is about future earth. Where the planet is getting too hot and too dry to survive. An engineer (Mathew McConaughey) is then sent on a mission to space to find another planet that could possibly support human life and thereby save the people of earth. After a long journey in space and time, he visits three candidate planets and manages to find the key to saving planet earth. The movie is both compelling and entertaining, with an interesting plot that is well acted. Interstellar's credits include many from Hollywood's ""a-list"" of actors and actresses, such as Mathew McConaughey as Cooper, Matt Damon as Mann, and Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain as Brand and Murph. Cooper is the main character, being the engineer that is sent to space on the mission to save the world. While Murph is his daughter, who is desperately waiting for the return of her father back home. Mathew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain do an incredible job of establishing a close father daughter relationship between Murph and Cooper in the film. Excellent direction by Christopher Nolen shows through in this visually stunning movie that relies on significant special affects, as over half the film is set in space. The movie includes multiple planets that were created with computer animation and other special effects. It is clear throughout the movie that Nolen not only created an impressive looking film, but he also did well in fitting the actors to their roles. Ultimately, Nolen made an excellent film that is both intriguing and filled with action. The combination of a fascinating setting and backdrop with a compelling storyline causes the film to hold the interest of the audience. The film takes place on the future earth that is burning beyond survival and extends all the way to worm holes in outer space. The other planets that were visited each had an extreme weather condition. These were shown in the film as very diverse landscapes and conditions such as: extreme cold, enormous waves, mountains of ice, and completely water covered. Cooper visits each place as the search is on to find a place that can support the future of mankind. I would recommend this movie because it is an interesting story that is filled with action, as well as impressive special effects that feel realistic and scientifically plausible. Although these events were fictional, the movie is very well made and directed such that the events of the movie seem believable and certainly exciting to watch.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","This film definitely took the place in my heart. I watched it in the cinema when it came out. And now I revise it at home. What to say... incredible. Until recently I've been yearning for science fiction. And now for the last two years of world film gave the audience the joy of a triptych of great films! It's gravity, interstellar and the Martian. I know that Mr. Nolan was inspired by the best representatives of this genre, in preparation for the creation of Interstellar. Of course, he did not forget about Space Odyssey Stanley Kubrick. Also I read in an interview with Nolan that one of his favorite Directors is Ridley Scott. So for me the obvious conjunction of these three movies about people in space in a single triptych. I applaud the imagination of the brothers Nolans. And the music by Hans Zimmer makes me want to plunge into the atmosphere of the present space where I'm unlikely to ever visit. But the creators of the film gave me that opportunity! What a huge thank you. No more words - better to just watch this wonderful film.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Interstellar is like nobody else's film. Instead, it claims science will save humanity, unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that use cutting-edge technologies. Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology.
Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most ignore it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Compassionate, smart young people convey this feeling. This conviction came about as a result of a worldwide war that swept out the vast majority of earthly lives - crops and individuals.
Although advanced technology is considered frivolous, agriculture is the main-one of the few survivors who understand the need for engineerings, Cooper (McConaughey). Having walked into NASA's headquarters (which had worked illegally because of media disapproval), he felt like a man lost in time. He finds those here who recognize that a return to our traditional ways is futile and eventually leads to our downfall. In order to save us, we need technology. As Michael Caine eloquently says to Cooper playing a genius, Professor Brand: ""We were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" The sound stole the stage for a film that won an Oscar for the Best Visual Effects. A success which was very accurately outside of this universe, Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy). I never saw a movie lifted by its scoring so far. Actually, the sound stole my breath. Forgive me the paragraph that follows. I'll go through the magic of this film's sound irresponsibly. Yeah, skip it. You've got your warning. Any big scene was driven by music. At every real moment, the harmonies of Zimmer captivated the attention of watchers in order to take on a mentor for a conversation in a locker room. The music shone through those emotional scenes in a manner that could be neither words nor visual ques, especially those featured by Cooper and his family. I was frozen, I was jagged, my cheeks were filled with tears, and my feelings were absolutely overcome by music. The sound entered my mind and spread through my body and brought me consciousness like a rhythm of heart pumping blood into my brains. The music really was the essence of the film's life.
Wow, both of us have experienced a spectacular success, an audacious artistic marvel we haven't seen since the beginning. Yeah, almost every actor has shown a commendable performance. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain flourishes into a galaxy. Michael Cain now exudes wisdom and intellect by merely being on the television, and people would be asking whether it was behind him that he had been cast as Albert Einstein. All this was taken into consideration, and the tone was still overall. I went outside the theater, hoping I had seen something special, something extraordinary. It inspires Celestial, awes, and mostly it entertains. More than that, I can't think.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

For instance, the visual effects were Oscar worthy and made my eyes rumble with amazement as well as giving you a fierce futuristic thrill of action and adventure. Christopher Nolan is arguably one one the greatest movie directors of all time and to have him as the films director impacts the film in a huge way. Small thing such as the camera angles and lighting does make a huge difference to the emotions to the film, but you may just not know it.

So I watched Interstellar on DVD. The sci-fi ambiance of Interstellar is more to my liking than The Martian's which is ruined by overuse of disco and Bowie. While I liked Interstellar in general, I found it very uneven. Cooper is heroic and idealistic but at times almost hysterical with unexpected emotional outbursts. Brand is an accomplished scientist but in the end admits she picks Edmund's planet for no reason other than love. And then there is Romilly who I think suffered the most for the longest time out of all the major characters.

Real life science backs up everything that is said and done throughout the story line. The music holds you in your seat and will blow you away, with the legendary Hans Zimmer behind it how can it not be good.

","The predictability of this movie decreased the overall energy of the film. Portions of the much appreciated science fiction elements of this movie bled out with the introduction of ridiculous futuristic AI technology as well as the heavy CGI. Additionally the science fiction elements along with the CGI were clashing during the films' attempted action scenes. The dialogue seemed more fitting for the characters when they were faced with life or death situations. The composition of this film was expected since I personally watch many science fiction movies. This would be an excellent movie to watch if you are an individual looking for aesthetics or something visually stimulating. In scenes with Matt Damon, the narrative seemed to make increasingly more sense both scientifically as well as dramatically which in my opinion added to the science fiction element. As the movie progresses however, much of the narrative becomes inconsistent and it becomes apparent with the strong cinematography.

","I was fortunate that I got to experience Interstellar On 4 November to the gala premiere in Imperial. As I walked out of the cinema, I had a feeling of emptiness.

I wanted to know how it all hung together, even when you walk out of the cinema you have more unanswered than answered questions. In a good way. For Christopher Nolan's film is not easily accessible. It requires empathy and the viewer is faithful in the belief that it is never as it seems outwardly when Christopher and Jonathan Nolan sits at the desk. After thinking about the movie for 72 hours and having seen the additional one time during the period, I can come up with, that it is not the space trip, which is relevant to the film.

19 March 2016,fahle,," A great Sci-Fi film
","I had the pleasure of watching Christopher Nolan's Interstellar recently and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie. At its core, this film is about the human race trying to find a new place to inhabit due to the deteriorating conditions on Earth. Time is of the essence to find a new home because crops are failing and sooner than later the human species could become extinct. The hero in this film is Joe Cooper who is played by Matthew McConaughey. Cooper is a former NASA pilot turned farmer after NASA became no more because it was said that taking care of Earth was more important that space exploration. Through an interesting series of events, Cooper finds what is left of NASA and is asked to go on a mission to save humanity. The driving force for Cooper to take on this mission is for the love of his family and for his love of humanity. This common thread is seen throughout the movie and often times drives Cooper to push himself past his perceived limits to accomplish what needs to be done. This theme of movie is summed up by this line ""Love is the one thing that we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space."" (2014). Love truly is one of those things that can transcend many things and its ability to do so is seen throughout this film.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

You can't part-timing watching this movie. You gotta sit focus and not missing any line. A movie that anyone can watch over and over again because of it's complicated story line especially to understand the scientific point of view. Unless if you already have that knowledge, I guess that won't be any problem. But if you don't then perhaps watching it over and over would clarify more things which is not a bad thing because at the same time you're learning about it. Definitely not a easy going movie to watch but one could appreciate it if taking a little bit of effort to focus and going deep into the movie. The movie indeed was very deep. My piece of advice if you in rush or noisy environment don't watch this. Late night would be ideal. That's when you're pretty much at peace. Go for it. Watch it.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

21 February 2017,ihawkeye-17640,10," Interstellar is Great!
","Traveling through the depths of space in order to save humanity from going extinct, that's a pretty big deal. Interstellar is an intense film telling the story of leaving Earth on an expedition in search of a new planet to call home for the human race. The 2014 hit movie directed by Christopher Nolan involves a strong cast, mind-blowing cinematics, and a creative and interesting plot. To begin, the movie strikes strongly with an in depth and well thought out plot. Nolan seems to have done his research and gotten reliable and respectable information to back up all of the important scientific aspects to the movie. The plot moves excitingly along, with each scene providing more fascinating information to pile on top. No doubt that a level of intenseness was achieved as you keep getting further and further into the movie. This intenseness provided in the film can give a huge thanks to the epic cinematics and animation used to create an awesome and stunning outer space, as well as the spaceships used, and the planets visited within the movie. The overall development throughout the film is very exciting. Each moment as the movie progresses just gets better, that is if you can sit down and enjoy from beginning to end. Interstellar is almost a whopping three hours long, so you have to have some time on your hands before you take a seat and enjoy this masterpiece. The film keeps you engaged the entire time despite its ridiculous length, which definitely adds to the quality of the film greatly. Now of course the plot, the cinematics, and the overall success of the movie would be nothing if it weren't for the acting crew assembled by Christopher Nolan. The lead character, Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, becomes the pilot for a mission to save humanity. With supporting actors like Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, and many more, the movie capitalized in great acting success, where I felt all roles were played phenomenally. I would not ask for different people to be substituted into their places, they all did excellent jobs. Along with that, there are some flaws with Interstellar, just like in any movie. To start, this film has some originality to it, for example in the exact plot and how events play out, but there are many films with a similar idea to them, such as Armageddon, Gravity, or Avatar. These movies are all relatable in the fact that people are going into space, and also in many of them people are attempting to save Earth from its destruction as well. Also, Christopher Nolan has a lot of the cinematics and detailed aspects that are similar to what these other films have done. With that being said, the movie has its downfalls, but it still remains a masterpiece. Overall, I feel that Interstellar achieved great success in many ways, and the numbers don't lie either. It is considered one of the biggest movies of our time and was very well done by Christopher Nolan. Through all the aspects of what it takes to make a film, Interstellar hit on most to really achieve being an amazing and enjoyable movie. Now not everyone may appreciate this film or feel that it is truly good, but go out and watch it and decide for yourself whether or not Interstellar is a movie for you.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

4 December 2016,dougdelt-1,10," An archetype spiritual message about Love, Death &
","I read a dozen reviews, and only one or two touch briefly on what is so special about this movie. The spirituality of the movie is deliberately hidden at first. It does this by explaining that dust is everywhere in the farm home that is the center of the opening scenes. Dust can fall in seemingly non-random ways, and a child can perceive messages near the bookshelf in her room that are surely not truly messages. Are they? We don't have to think so. And by accident you can learn things from it, as she does... But by the end of the movie, the daughter learns that someone as good as dead indeed was communicating with her all along. Her watch's second hand on the bookshelf twitches while she is a young lady, and she does not perceive any possibility of a message in that seemingly random act. Or is it random? Then Dr. Brand / Anne Hathaway during the mission talks about love for the dead, or those we should assume dead, has no evolutionary advantage, yet it is real. It turns out that the one she pines for on Edmund's planet is a love she wants to follow, but science says no. He is likely dead. He has no clear message as strong as Dr. Mann that his planet which he found is ideal for repopulating earth. We must instead go to Mann's planet. Thus, Dr. Mann represents another message -- a tempting message -- to follow ... to a world of an habitable planet, of water, of good air, etc. ",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

11 February 2018,kikoigri,10," A movie that truly engages the mind.
","To begin with this film is representative of any dystopian fiction motion-picture with the only difference being truly astonishing cinematography and a subtle hint at a hidden story that engages the viewer. The crisis within the movie which is the source and the base of the plot isn't very well described however this is justified as it is not necessarily relevant to the plot due to the plot being based on a crisis and not on the type of crisis. while this lack of description may be perceived as a flaw in the scripting of the movie I believe it helps this movie be more concise seeing as it is three hours long anyway.
The first scenes before the story unfolds are mainly used to give the viewer an idea of the setting and the characters and seems to be the most criticised part of the movie with comments often describing it as 'boring'. however it only covers 11.7 percent of the film. Once the true story unfolds it begins to engage the cognitive part of the viewer's brain unlike any other sci-fi film i have ever seen by not only presenting logical and scientific problems but also emotional tragedies that engage the empathy of the viewer. 
The story truly unfolds when Cooper goes on his journey and this marks the first emotional challenge in the movie. The movie then goes on to explore ethical challenges in the world and really gives the viewer insight into the thoughts and emotions humans experience when faced with a dilemma as the one presented by 'plan A' and 'plan B'.This dilemma is a classical one of risk more to gain more or risk less but gain less and is something everyone goes through no matter what scale it is on wether it be the immense, immeasurable scale given in this movie or something minor in everyday life. 
Many say that this movie is confusing and hard to understand, however, this is simply because it explores oxymorons and paradoxes that can't be understood with mere logic. One such paradox is time and time is a recurring theme in this movie seemingly representing every challenge humanity faces: the time we have with loved ones and the time we ourselves have. Time is represented as many things and one of them is as a resource, as something that we can see or a fourth dimension - the fourth dimension. Most of this confusion comes from the way time is presented and the ways the movie uses scientific theories and paradoxes to represent time but this is what truly engages the viewer - it is the reason why the movie can be three hours long, it's because it presents mental challenges that can keep a viewer engaged for days and not just a mere three hours.
Overall, this movie is a masterpiece: it is not only a movie with impressive effects but one that combines effects with an ingenious plot. The way time is presented as a tangible dimension can only be classified as astounding considering that time is not something humanity has much expertise with. moreover the beautiful effects of space - especially in panic are mesmerising for example the flooding of sound once a vessel is pressurised are very impressively done. The plot has virtually no holes and it is surprisingly scientifically accurate with the exceptions of concepts regarding black holes. To conclude, the way it presents the unknown is the magic of this movie and that is why I rate 10 stars.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

Human history will change after this movie. The human history will be divided into two parts: before and after Interstellar. It is not an exaggeration to say that if this film is demanded to be forcibly taught in schools and universities, to be taught to children from an early age, and to be forcibly shown in offices and organizations every month, it should be done! This is the duty of the government, and it is necessary for the development of society. Everyone should be obliged to watch this human-making and history-making work two to three times a month, like a medicine prescription that needs to be repeated.

i didn't like Amélia, because she went toward the waves and she was annoying, but, the acting was good ( Anne Hathaway did a good role as a dumb person).
I think the plot was cool ( I liked the planets, the other galaxy), but I thought the ending of the movie ( when Cooper discovers that he is the ghost and he saw Murph´s room etc) was confusing.

","It's incredible. This film fully provides tension in two different spaces. The casts perform their roles very smoothly and without the slightest mistake or contrived. What happens around you then that's what you have to deal with. You can't escape from reality, that's the point. The field of science in this film is so thick that I had to think twice to successfully understand it. Completely unpredictable life or objects that are out there. The concept of time dilation is very visible and right on target.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let me just say that I have never ""reviewed"" any movie before, good or bad. This movie is neither, it is *absolutely breathtaking*. I have never seen a movie that combines music and visuals so perfectly, i have never seen a movie where the details are just so presize, and I have definitely never seen a movie where after watching for the fifth time, the goosebumps and thrills keep me near speechless for so long. I just finished watching this movie for the fifth time and I will wait for the day that there will be a movie to surpass this masterpiece.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Watching this movie with an open mind is best best thing to do. its nothing like you would expect. With great actors such as Matthew McConaughey its hard not to keep interested. The film is long but take your time and capture every second. Trust me, its worth it in the end.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

","Very nice film. I recommend this to everyone and hope everyone watches it. Anyone who reads Old and Middle English literary texts will be familiar with the mid-brown volumes of the EETS, with the symbol of Alfred's jewel embossed on the front cover. Most of the works attributed to King Alfred or to Aelfric, along with some of those by bishop Wulfstan and much anonymous prose and verse from the pre-Conquest period, are to be found w",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv

1 February 2020,moolarchy,10," Astonishing until the ending
","Interstellar is everything i've ever looked for in a film. The set decoration, the acting, the story, the VFX, and writing are all on a level which I have been searching for. On my first watch through (the first of 27), I was simply amazed at how immersed into the story I was. I have never been what you'd call a crying man, but many times did I face emotion that overwhelmed me. I am truly happy that I've seen this film.
My favorite film, The Truman Show, is yet to be taken from its spot, but nearly was. Interstellar would've been the perfect movie if it weren't for the too-happy sequel ready ending. I would've done much better with the film ending at Cooper floating, as seen before he wakes up in the hospital. I wouldn't be unsatisfied with the cutoff ending, but left wondering.",/review/rw5452812/?ref_=tt_urv
